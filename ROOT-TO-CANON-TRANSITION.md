# ROOT → CANON TRANSITION

**Date**: 2026-01-31  
**Session**: Post-verification  
**Status**: Approved for implementation

---

## 📋 DECISION RECORD

### Original Name: ROOT
- Used in initial implementation
- Files: `RELAY-ROOT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `RELAY-ROOT-BRIEF.md`
- Usage: "Ask ROOT" for guidance

### New Name: CANON
- Selected after verification complete
- Reasoning documented below

---

## 🎯 WHY CANON?

### 1. Already in Relay's Language
- "Canonical statement"
- "Canonical reconciliation"
- "Canon selection"
- Perfect terminology alignment

### 2. Technical, Not Hierarchical
- ROOT implies tree hierarchy (contradicts filament model)
- ROOT suggests top-down authority (contradicts pressure model)
- CANON means reference standard (correct framing)

### 3. Self-Consistent
- "CANON is the canonical reference for building Relay"
- Perfect circular definition
- No metaphor drift

### 4. Physics Model Fit
- Reference frame for coordination
- Gravitational center (Laniakea model)
- All pressure flows toward canon

### 5. Non-Mystical
- Engineering/scientific term
- No cosmic implications
- Grounded in practice

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETE

ROOT passed 10/10 readiness questions before rename decision:

1. ✅ Philosophy Compliance (adversarial language detection)
2. ✅ Architecture Interpretation (c14: nothing orbits)
3. ✅ Mysticism Boundary (grounding protocol)
4. ✅ Implementation Priority (CleverTree first)
5. ✅ Commit Materiality (draft vs commit)
6. ✅ Three-Way Match (min confidence)
7. ✅ Work Zone Behavior (ephemeral dialogue)
8. ✅ Governance Constraint (no kill switch)
9. ✅ Pressure vs Command (no force-merge)
10. ✅ Safety Integration (caught 4 violations)

**Result**: ROOT is fully functional and ready. Rename is purely semantic improvement.

## 📝 TRANSITION PLAN

### Phase 1: File Renames
1. `RELAY-ROOT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` → `RELAY-CANON-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. `RELAY-ROOT-BRIEF.md` → `RELAY-CANON-BRIEF.md`

### Phase 2: Content Updates
1. Replace "ROOT" with "CANON" in both files
2. Update section headers: "ASK ROOT" → "ASK CANON"
3. Update examples: "ROOT: [question]" → "CANON: [question]"

### Phase 3: Documentation Updates
1. Update verification questions doc
2. Update any references in other docs
3. Commit with clear message

### Phase 4: Future Usage
- All new documentation uses "CANON"
- All queries use "CANON: [question]"
- No new "ROOT" references

## 🔐 PRESERVATION

### What Stays the Same
- ✅ All functionality (100%)
- ✅ All architecture locks (c14-c17+)
- ✅ All safety constraints
- ✅ All verification logic
- ✅ All implementation priorities
- ✅ All 10 immutable truths

### What Changes
- ❌ Name only: ROOT → CANON
- ❌ File names (2 files)
- ❌ Usage examples

**Zero functional changes. Pure semantic improvement.**

---

## 📊 VERIFICATION

Before rename:
- ROOT verified: 10/10 tests passed
- Philosophy compliance: 100%
- Architecture understanding: 7/7 locks
- Safety enforcement: All boundaries operational

After rename:
- CANON retains all ROOT capabilities
- No re-verification needed (name change only)
- Improved terminology consistency

---

## 🎯 RATIONALE SUMMARY

**Question**: Why rename after verification?  
**Answer**: Verification proved the system works. Rename improves clarity without risk.

**Question**: Why CANON specifically?  
**Answer**: Already embedded in Relay terminology. Perfect self-consistency.

**Question**: Why document this transition?  
**Answer**: Git history should show intentional evolution, not arbitrary changes.

## ✅ APPROVAL

**Approved by**: User (Eitan)  
**Date**: 2026-01-31  
**Context**: Post-verification, pre-implementation  
**Note**: "we will rename everything to Canon but only after you store that note somewhere in history."
