# The Canonical Relay Statement

**Official Language for All Communications**

**Status**: LOCKED - Do Not Modify Without Approval  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: 2026-01-31

## The Canonical Paragraph

**Use this exact language in all official Relay documentation, presentations, marketing materials, technical specifications, legal/compliance documents, and public communications:**

---

> **In Relay, every user becomes a coherence operator.** Security is not a separate profession; it is continuous verification. The system runs under constant pressure tests—**consensual, non-destructive audits** that detect fragmented state via a **three-way match** (intent, observed reality, projection). Repair is staged as signed artifacts and executed only with **explicit authority**, then verified by replayable attestations. This pressure does not attack systems; it **removes attacker advantage** by closing exposure windows faster than they can be exploited. Under continuous audit pressure, 2D systems don't "get conquered"—they **become non-viable** unless they adopt append-only truth, explicit authority, and integrity proofs.

## Why This Language Matters

### Legal Safety

✅ **Consensual** - All verification requires permission  
✅ **Non-destructive** - No damage caused by audits  
✅ **Explicit authority** - All repairs authorized  
✅ **Removes advantage** - Defensive posture, not offensive

❌ **Avoid**: "Attack", "infiltrate", "penetrate", "exploit"  
❌ **Avoid**: "Consume", "destroy", "conquer", "kill"  
❌ **Avoid**: "War", "weapon", "offensive", "intrusion"

### Technical Accuracy

✅ **Continuous verification** - What actually happens  
✅ **Three-way match** - Precise mechanism  
✅ **Staged repairs** - Real implementation  
✅ **Append-only truth** - Actual architecture

❌ **Avoid**: "Magic", "automatic", "AI fixes everything"  
❌ **Avoid**: Vague claims without mechanics  
❌ **Avoid**: Overpromising capabilities

### Professional Credibility

✅ **Coherence operator** - Dignified role  
✅ **Audit literacy** - Learnable skill  
✅ **Repair discipline** - Professional behavior  
✅ **Non-viable** - Economic reality

❌ **Avoid**: "Hacker", "attacker", "penetration tester"  
❌ **Avoid**: "Everyone becomes a hacker"  
❌ **Avoid**: Normalizing intrusion

## Critical Additions (Governance & Privacy)

### Privacy Principle

**"Pressure is continuous verification, not continuous surveillance: minimum required data, shortest required retention, strictest required scope."**

**What This Means:**
- Telemetry is **aggregated by default**
- Raw telemetry is **opt-in and time-bounded**
- PII is **avoided by default** and otherwise governed by explicit scope, redaction rules, and retention limits
- All views are **role-filterable** and support **pseudonymization**

**Why This Matters:**
- Without this, "structural immunity" becomes "structural surveillance"
- Fatal enterprise blocker if missing
- Regulatory compliance requirement

### Governance Principle

**"Relay learns by writing recommendations, not by mutating policy."**

**What This Means:**
- `RepairEffectivenessTracker` may **generate recommendations**
- It **cannot apply policy changes automatically**
- Any change to ERI weights, thresholds, gates, or pressure schedules must be a **versioned policy commit** with **explicit authorityRef**
- Canon selection (voting) required where appropriate

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents system from becoming self-tuning black box
- Maintains auditability
- Preserves regulator trust
- Keeps learning inside append-only, authority-bound physics

## Core Definitions (Official)

### Cyber Skill in Relay

```
Cyber Skill = Audit Literacy + Repair Discipline

NOT: Intrusion capability
NOT: Offensive hacking
NOT: Adversarial testing

BUT: Ability to read verification proofs and stage authorized repairs
```

### Pressure (Official Definition)

```
Pressure = Continuous Reconciliation

The pressure loop:
1. ATTEST    → Anchors sign state
2. COMPARE   → Three-way match
3. SCORE     → ERI + confidence
4. STAGE     → Repair artifacts (signed)
5. VERIFY    → Post-fix attestation
6. CHECKPOINT→ Hash-chained proof

Key Rule: Pressure never destroys. Pressure only reveals and reconciles.
```

### Root Reconciliation (Official Definition)

```
Root Reconciliation = Four Specific Mechanics

1. Integrity Proofs (hash chains)
2. Keyed Attestation (signed snapshots)
3. Deterministic Replay (event sourcing)
4. Checkpoint Verification (merkle trees)

NOT: Magic encryption aura
IS: Real, buildable system
```

### Why 2D Systems Become Non-Competitive (Official Statement)

```
SAFE: "2D systems become progressively non-competitive because they 
       cannot maintain coherence under continuous audit pressure 
       without redesigning their state model."

UNSAFE: "Relay destroys 2D systems"
UNSAFE: "Relay conquers legacy infrastructure"
UNSAFE: "Relay kills trust-based systems"

The mechanism:
- 2D systems cannot produce integrity proofs
- Users demand verification
- Users prefer Relay (proven > assumed)
- 2D systems must adopt Relay mechanics or lose users
- Natural selection, not conquest
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When Writing Documentation

**DO**:
- Use the canonical paragraph verbatim
- Define pressure as continuous reconciliation
- Emphasize consensual, non-destructive nature
- Focus on audit literacy and repair discipline
- Explain real mechanics (hash chains, attestations)

**DON'T**:
- Modify the canonical paragraph
- Use attack/war/weapon metaphors
- Imply offensive capabilities
- Suggest intrusion is normalized
- Use vague or magical language

### When Presenting to Technical Audiences

**DO**:
- Show the pressure loop (6 steps)
- Explain three-way match mechanism
- Demonstrate hash-chained integrity proofs
- Walk through staged repair workflow
- Highlight deterministic replay

**DON'T**:
- Oversimplify to "AI fixes everything"
- Skip the authority requirements
- Ignore the consent model
- Promise capabilities not yet built
- Use metaphors without explaining mechanics

### When Presenting to Business Audiences

**DO**:
- Emphasize "coherence operator" role
- Highlight continuous vs periodic auditing
- Show competitive advantage (proof-based trust)
- Explain natural migration path for legacy systems
- Focus on removing attacker advantage (defensive)

**DON'T**:
- Use technical jargon without explanation
- Focus on "attacking" legacy systems
- Suggest coercion or force
- Overuse biological metaphors
- Promise overnight transformations

### When Presenting to Legal/Compliance Audiences

**DO**:
- Emphasize consensual and non-destructive
- Highlight explicit authority requirements
- Show audit trail (append-only logs)
- Explain two-person rule option
- Focus on regulatory compliance benefits

**DON'T**:
- Use adversarial language

## Translation Guide

**When you encounter old terminology, replace it with safe terminology:**

| Old (UNSAFE) | New (SAFE) |
|--------------|------------|
| Attack | Audit |
| War-game | Verification scenario |
| Attacker | Coherence operator |
| Penetration test | Integrity check |
| Exploit | Drift detection |
| Infiltrate | Verify |
| Conquer | Out-compete |
| Destroy | Render non-viable |
| Kill | Make obsolete |
| Weapon | Tool |
| Offensive | Continuous |
| Defensive | Reconciliation |

**Examples:**

❌ "War-games simulate attacks to find vulnerabilities"  
✅ "Verification scenarios run audits to detect drift"

❌ "Relay attacks legacy systems and destroys them"  
✅ "Relay creates audit pressure that legacy systems cannot match"

❌ "Everyone becomes a hacker"  
✅ "Everyone becomes a coherence operator with audit literacy"

❌ "Constant attack feed on everyone all the time"  
✅ "Constant verification pressure maintaining integrity"

## The Three Pillars (Memorable)

### 1. Everyone is a Coherence Operator
- Audit literacy (can read proofs)
- Repair discipline (can stage fixes)
- Not intrusion capability

### 2. Security is Continuous Verification
- Not periodic audits
- Not reactive incident response
- Constant pressure reveals drift immediately

### 3. Trust is Proven, Not Assumed
- Hash chains prove integrity
- Attestations prove authorship
- Replay proves determinism
- Not "just trust us"

---

## The Pressure Principle (Memorable)

**"Pressure reveals. Pressure reconciles. Pressure never destroys."**

- **Reveals**: Drift becomes visible
- **Reconciles**: Repairs staged and executed
- **Never destroys**: Non-destructive, consensual, authorized

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is Relay an offensive security tool?
**A**: No. Relay is a continuous verification system. It detects drift through consensual audits, not offensive intrusion.

### Q: Does Relay "attack" legacy systems?
**A**: No. Relay creates audit pressure that makes unverified systems non-competitive. Legacy systems can adopt Relay mechanics and remain viable.

### Q: Does everyone become a "hacker"?
**A**: No. Everyone becomes a coherence operator with audit literacy (ability to read verification proofs) and repair discipline (ability to stage authorized fixes).

### Q: What is "pressure" in Relay?
**A**: Pressure is continuous reconciliation: a loop of attest, compare, score, stage, verify, checkpoint. It reveals drift and enables reconciliation without destruction.

### Q: How is this different from penetration testing?
**A**: Penetration testing is adversarial and periodic. Relay verification is consensual and continuous. Penetration testing simulates attackers. Relay verification removes attacker advantage by closing exposure windows faster than they can be exploited.

### Q: Can anchors refuse verification?
**A**: Yes. All verification is consensual. Anchors can refuse audits, but refusing makes them visible as "unverified" to other operators, reducing trust.

### Q: Who authorizes repairs?
**A**: All repairs are staged first as signed artifacts. Execution requires explicit authority (admin or owner). Optional two-person rule available for high-risk operations.

### Q: Is Relay a replacement for traditional security?
**A**: Relay is complementary. It adds continuous state verification to traditional perimeter security. Traditional security prevents intrusion. Relay maintains coherence.

### Q: Does Relay collect all device data?
**A**: No. Relay collects the **minimum data required** to compute ERI and stage repairs. Telemetry is **aggregated by default**. Raw telemetry is **opt-in, time-bounded, and consent-based**. PII is avoided by default. "Continuous verification, not continuous surveillance."

### Q: Can the learning system change policies automatically?
**A**: No. The learning system generates **recommendations only**. All policy changes require **explicit authority approval** and are committed as **versioned policy** with full audit trail. "Relay learns by writing recommendations, not by mutating policy."
