## Understanding Democratic Governance

The Relay governance system embodies authentic democracy by ensuring that community members have direct control over decisions affecting their lives. Unlike representative systems where elected officials make decisions on behalf of constituents, Relay enables direct participation in proposal development, discussion, and implementation.

**Key Democratic Principles:**

**Direct Participation**: Every community member can propose improvements and participate in decisions
**Transparent Process**: All governance activities occur with complete visibility and accountability
**Inclusive Engagement**: Multiple opportunities for diverse voices and perspectives
**Collective Responsibility**: Communities share ownership of both decisions and outcomes
