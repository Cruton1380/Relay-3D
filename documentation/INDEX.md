## Recent Updates

### **January 2026 - Philosophy Tightening & Continuous Verification**

**Philosophy Refinement**: Relay's core philosophy has been tightened from metaphorical to mechanical, ensuring legal safety and technical precision:

**Core Definitions**:
- ✅ Cyber Skill = Audit Literacy + Repair Discipline (NOT intrusion)
- ✅ Pressure = Continuous Reconciliation (NOT attacks)
- ✅ Root Reconciliation = 4 mechanics: integrity proofs, attestation, replay, checkpoints
- ✅ Canonical Statement locked for all communications

**New Systems**:
- ✅ Pressure Feed (PF): Real-time stream of drift alerts, attestation status, policy mismatches
- ✅ Pressure Actions (PA): Consensual, non-destructive verification operations
- ✅ Pressure Loop: 6-step mechanical cycle (attest, compare, score, stage, verify, checkpoint)

**Safe Language**:
- ✅ "Coherence operator" (not "cyber professional" or "hacker")
- ✅ "Continuous verification" (not "war-games" or "attacks")
- ✅ "Non-competitive" (not "consumed" or "destroyed")

**Documentation**:
- ✅ `CANONICAL-RELAY-STATEMENT.md` - Official locked statement
- ✅ `RELAY-TURGOR-PRESSURE-PHILOSOPHY.md` (v2.0) - Safe philosophical explanation
- ✅ `TECHNICAL/PRESSURE-FEED-SPECIFICATION.md` - Buildable implementation spec

### **January 2026 - Filament System & Git-Native Migration**

**System Evolution**: Relay has evolved to a **Git-native truth layer** with **Filament System visualization**:

**Truth Layer Migration**:
- ✅ Git replaces blockchain + hashgraph (simpler, faster, standard tooling)
- ✅ Commits replace transactions (instant writes, no batching)
- ✅ Query hooks replace state service (derived aggregates on demand)
- ✅ Envelopes provide structured metadata (parsable commits)

**Filament Visualization System**:
- ✅ Filaments (persistent identities over time)
- ✅ TimeBoxes (atomic truth units with 6 semantic faces)
- ✅ Glyphs (8 canonical operations: STAMP, KINK, DENT, TWIST, UNTWIST, GATE, SPLIT, SCAR)
- ✅ Views (Globe = X-collapsed, Workflow = X-expanded, Spreadsheet = projection)
- ✅ Playback motor (navigate history with play/pause/step)

**New Conceptual Models**:
- ✅ User as World Fractal (profiles as projection lenses)
- ✅ Presence + Permission (Tier 1: counts only, policy-driven visibility)
- ✅ KPIs as Filaments (first-class states with commit history)
- ✅ Topology as Emergent Lens (dependencies in TimeBox faces)
- ✅ Editable Endpoint Lens (spreadsheet cells project filament +X faces)

**Documentation Updates**:
- ✅ 7 new canonical documentation files created
- ✅ Legacy docs archived to `documentation/LEGACY/`
- ✅ New `documentation/VISUALIZATION/` folder with complete filament system docs
- ✅ Surgical updates to core docs (SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE, MIGRATION-PROGRESS, RELAY-OVERVIEW)

**See**: [Filament System Overview](VISUALIZATION/FILAMENT-SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md), [Git-Native Truth Model](TECHNICAL/GIT-NATIVE-TRUTH-MODEL.md)
