# Relay Filament System Architecture

**Status**: Post-cleanup, Git-native truth layer  
**Version**: v1.0 (Filament Migration)  
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-26

---

## Core Architecture

### Truth Layer: Git + Commit Envelopes

**All truth lives in Git commits with `.relay/envelope.json` metadata.**

```
Git Commit
├── .relay/envelope.json         (canonical metadata - all 7 commit classes)
├── state/candidates/*.yaml      (domain state files)
└── derived/step-N/*.{png,json}  (immutable derived artifacts)
```

**No external databases. No in-memory aggregates. No WebSockets pushing truth.**

---

## System Components

### 1. `.relay/` Hooks (Truth Gatekeepers)

| Hook | Purpose | Enforcement |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `pre-commit.mjs` | Validates commits before acceptance | Hard-gates envelope presence, schema, step monotonicity |
| `query.mjs` | Derives aggregates from commit history | Returns vote counts, rankings, metrics (read-only) |
| `get.mjs` | Projects commits to sheet/inspector views | Renders 3D time boxes, 2D sheets, face data |

---

### 2. Domain Registry (Universal History Substrate)

**Location**: `domains/*.domain.json`

**3 domains implemented**:
1. `voting.domain.json` — Channels, candidates, vote counts
2. `prompt.domain.json` — AI prompt evolution, eval results
3. `storyboard.domain.json` — Video frame sequences, renders

**Each domain defines**:
- Face mappings (+X output, -X deps, +Y meaning, -Y magnitude, +Z identity, -Z evidence)
- Sheet schemas (columns, views, editability, projection rules)
- Commit classes allowed (CELL_EDIT, ROW_CREATE, etc.)
- Operators (add_row, archive_row, run_eval, etc.)

---

### 3. Commit Envelope v1 (Universal Metadata)

**Every commit includes** `.relay/envelope.json` with:
- `envelope_version`, `domain_id`, `commit_class`
- `scope` (repo/branch/bundle), `step` (dense step timeline)
- `actor`, `selection` (stable IDs across 3D/2D/globe)
- `change` (rows_touched, cells_touched, files_written, derived_artifacts)
- `validation` (schema_version, hashes)

**7 Commit Classes**:
1. `CELL_EDIT` — One cell changed
2. `FORMULA_EDIT` — Formula/prompt text changed
3. `ROW_CREATE` — New identity added
4. `ROW_ARCHIVE` — Row marked inactive (never deleted)
5. `RANGE_EDIT` — Batch changes (reorder, bulk edit)
6. `ATTACHMENT_ADD` — Evidence or derived artifact attached
7. `OPERATOR_RUN` — Evaluation, render, aggregation run

---

### 4. Step Counter (Branch-Safe Monotonicity)

**Location**: `.relay/state/step-counters.json`

**Scope keying**: `scope_type:repo_id:branch_id:bundle_id`

**Rules**:
- Each scope maintains its own dense step counter
- Pre-commit hook enforces: `envelope.scope_step === expectedNextStep`
- No skips, no repeats, no parallel step conflicts
- Branches advance independently (for merge, realign at UI/query layer)

---

### 5. Relay Client (PUT/GET/QUERY)

**Location**: `src/backend/relay-client/index.mjs`

**Methods**:
- `put(repo, files)` — Write commit with envelope
- `get(repo, path)` — Read file or projection
- `query(repo, endpoint, params)` — Derived aggregates
- `subscribe(repo, callback)` — SSE/polling for new commits

**Replaces**:
- ~~Blockchain transactions~~
- ~~WebSocket vote push~~
- ~~In-memory vote-service aggregates~~

---

## Data Flow

### Write Path (e.g., Vote Cast)

```
User clicks vote
  ↓
UI calls envelope-builder.buildCellEditEnvelope({
    domain_id: "voting.channel",
    row_key: candidate_id,
    col_id: "user_votes",  // not votes_total (that's derived)
    before: null,
    after: { user_id, value: +1 }
  })
  ↓
relay-client.put(`/repo/${repo_id}`, {
    ".relay/envelope.json": envelope,
    "state/candidates/${candidate_id}.yaml": updated_state
  })
  ↓
pre-commit hook validates:
  - Envelope present, schema valid
  - Step === expectedNextStep
  - Files match manifest
  - Column is editable (not derived)
  ↓
Git commit lands
  ↓
Step counter increments
  ↓
[UI polls or receives SSE notification]
  ↓
UI calls relay-client.query("/voting_rankings")
  ↓
query hook reads envelopes, aggregates votes_total, returns rankings
  ↓
UI renders new counts
```

---

### Read Path (e.g., Globe Rendering)

```
Globe component mounts
  ↓
Calls relay-client.query("/voting_rankings", {
    repo: "coffee-shop__seattle",
    branch: "bean-there__main",
    step: "latest"
  })
  ↓
query.mjs:
  - Reads .relay/state/step-counters.json (current step)
  - Walks Git history (or reads envelope index)
  - For each CELL_EDIT on voting domain:
      Track (user_id, candidate_id, vote_value, step)
  - Apply last-vote-wins rule
  - Aggregate: votes_total = sum per candidate
  - Sort, assign rank
  - Return { candidates: [...], metrics: {...} }
  ↓
Globe renders candidates with votes_total (derived, read-only)
```

---

## 3D ↔ 2D Workflow (Filament UI)

### Filament Space (3D)
- Filaments = identity over time (row of Time Boxes on X-axis)
- Branches = competing versions (proposals)
- Globe = macro navigation shell (zoom to find filaments)

### Sheet Mode (2D)
- Spreadsheet-like projection of filament tip or cross-section
- Columns = domain schema columns (editable + derived)
- Editing a cell → emits CELL_EDIT commit → new Time Box appears
- Face Inspector = 6-face cube view of selected Time Box

## What Was Removed (Post-Cleanup)

### Deleted Infrastructure (28,515 lines)
- ❌ `src/backend/blockchain-service/` (42 files) — Replaced by Git
- ❌ `src/backend/hashgraph/` (38 files) — Replaced by Git
- ❌ `src/backend/vote-service/` (1 file) — Replaced by query hooks
- ❌ `src/backend/websocket-service/` (12 files) — Replaced by SSE/polling
- ❌ `src/backend/state/` (2 files) — Replaced by Git commits

### Deleted Clutter (287+ files)
- ❌ `archive/` — 259 obsolete status reports
- ❌ `backups/` — Redundant (Git has all history)
- ❌ `IncompleteImplementations/` — Not needed
- ❌ `DELETION-PHASE-COMPLETE.md` and other root status docs

### Preserved
- ✅ `documentation/` — Organized API, architecture, guides (88 essential docs)
- ✅ `domains/` — Domain registry configs (3 domains)
- ✅ `.relay/` — Hooks, envelope schema, step counters
- ✅ `src/` — Frontend + backend application logic
- ✅ `scripts/` — 85 test/utility scripts
- ✅ Essential config files, package.json, README.md, LICENSE

## Current Status

**Truth layer**: ✅ Git-only (no external DBs)  
**Commit envelope**: ✅ v1 schema implemented with pre-commit validation  
**Query hooks**: ✅ v1 with envelopes/sheet_tip/voting_rankings (Git integration pending)  
**Step counter**: ✅ Branch-safe monotonicity enforced  
**Root cleanup**: ✅ Professional structure (287 files organized/deleted)  

**Remaining work**:
1. Fix 43 broken imports (replace state.* / vote-service.* with query hooks)
2. Implement Git integration in query hooks (envelope replay)
3. Build vertical slice: Prompt CELL_EDIT → commit → new Time Box
4. Implement 3D/2D UI components (Time Box renderer, Sheet Mode)

---

## Key Principles

1. **Git is the only truth** — No second database, no in-memory state
2. **Envelopes make commits parsable** — Every commit is a structured event
3. **Query hooks derive everything** — vote_total, rank, metrics are read-only
4. **Faces are audit surfaces** — 6-face cube for identity/evidence/meaning
5. **Sheets are work surfaces** — Spreadsheet-like editing emits commits
6. **Dense steps align history** — Gantt timeline with carry boxes
7. **Branches are proposals** — Merge = approval, conflicts = competing truths
8. **UI never computes truth** — Always call query hooks, never aggregate locally

---

**This architecture is now provable, auditable, and Git-native.**
