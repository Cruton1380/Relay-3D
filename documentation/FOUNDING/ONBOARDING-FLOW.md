# 🚀 Complete Onboarding Flow: From Invitation to Full Access

## Executive Summary

Relay's multi-phase onboarding process transforms newcomers into fully verified community members through a security-first, user-friendly journey. The system balances robust identity verification with progressive complexity, introducing users to cryptographic security, social verification, and governance participation in manageable steps. At its core, the process establishes three critical foundations: a verifiable cryptographic identity anchored by biometric security, a genuine social trust network validated through real-world connections, and governance participation rights earned through progressive verification steps.

What makes Relay's approach unique is its seamless integration of cutting-edge security (zero-knowledge proofs, multi-factor biometrics, and device attestation) with intuitive user experiences that clearly explain the purpose behind each step. By combining physical proximity verification with cryptographic identity and progressive token allocation, Relay creates a Sybil-resistant ecosystem where governance participation is reserved for verified humans with genuine social connections—all while protecting user privacy and providing multiple paths based on user comfort levels.

### **Phase 4: Security Configuration**

#### **Step 5: Guardian Recovery Setup**
*[Detailed in USER-GUIDES/GUARDIAN-RECOVERY-USER-GUIDE.md]*

Guardian Recovery is Relay's social recovery system that empowers trusted friends to help you regain access to your account if you lose your device or face other access issues. Unlike traditional password reset systems, Guardian Recovery distributes trust across your personal network using cryptographic threshold schemes.

**How Guardian Recovery Works:**

1. **Cryptographic Sharing**: Your account recovery key is split into multiple encrypted shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing
2. **Distributed Trust**: These shares are securely distributed to your chosen guardians
3. **Threshold Recovery**: Only a predetermined number of guardians (threshold) need to assist for recovery
4. **Zero Knowledge**: Guardians never see or possess your actual recovery key
5. **Multi-Factor Verification**: Recovery requires both guardian assistance and additional identity verification

**Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// Simplified implementation of guardian share creation
function createGuardianShares(accountKey, guardians, threshold) {
  // Generate recovery seed from account key
  const recoverySeed = deriveRecoverySeed(accountKey);
  
  // Split into shares with threshold cryptography
  const shares = shamirSplit(recoverySeed, {
    shares: guardians.length,
    threshold: threshold,  // Minimum needed for recovery
    polynomial: 3          // Security parameter
  });
  
  // Encrypt each share with guardian's public key
  const encryptedShares = guardians.map((guardian, i) => {
    return {
      guardianId: guardian.id,
      encryptedShare: encryptWithPublicKey(guardian.publicKey, shares[i])
    };
  });
  
  return encryptedShares;
}
```

**Alice's Experience:**
When Alice sets up Guardian Recovery, she chooses her close friends Bob, Carol, and David as guardians. Each guardian receives a notification requesting their help as account guardians. If Alice ever loses her phone, she can initiate recovery from a new device, which notifies her guardians. When two of them approve the recovery request (by performing a simple biometric verification on their own devices), Alice can regain access to her account after completing her own identity verification step.

#### **Step 6: Device Security Integration**

Device Security Integration connects Relay's authentication system with your device's native security features to create multiple layers of protection. This integration leverages platform-specific security capabilities like secure enclaves, hardware security modules, and biometric systems.

**Security Architecture Benefits:**

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers prevent single points of failure
2. **Platform Optimization**: Utilizes the best security features of each device type
3. **Seamless Experience**: Security measures work together for frictionless usage
4. **Tamper Resistance**: Device hardware security prevents extraction of sensitive keys
5. **Continuous Protection**: Security remains active even when the app is closed

**Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// Device security integration process
async function setupDeviceSecurity() {
  // Check device security capabilities
  const capabilities = await deviceSecurity.checkCapabilities();
  
  // Configure based on available features
  const securityConfig = {
    biometricType: capabilities.biometricTypes[0] || null,
    secureStorage: capabilities.hasSecureEnclave ? 'enclave' : 'software',
    screenLockRequired: true,
    inactivityLockout: 300, // seconds
    remoteWipeEnabled: capabilities.supportsRemoteWipe,
    attestationType: selectBestAttestation(capabilities)
  };
  
  // Initialize security systems
  await Promise.all([
    setupBiometricUnlock(securityConfig.biometricType),
    configureSecureStorage(securityConfig.secureStorage),
    registerDeviceWithRemoteServices(securityConfig),
    setupAutomaticLocking(securityConfig.inactivityLockout)
  ]);
  
  return securityConfig;
}
```

**Device Security Checklist:**
```
Device Security Checklist:
├─ Enable device PIN/password
├─ Set up biometric unlock (Face ID/Touch ID)
├─ Configure automatic app locking
├─ Enable remote device wipe capability
└─ Set up find-my-device integration
```

**Alice's Experience:**
During this step, Alice is guided through enabling critical security features on her iPhone. The system detects that she already has Face ID configured and automatically integrates with it. Alice sets her Relay app to automatically lock after 5 minutes of inactivity, and enables the emergency remote wipe feature that would protect her data if her phone were lost or stolen. The entire process takes less than 2 minutes, and her device is now fortified against unauthorized access.

### **Phase 5: Community Integration**

#### **Step 7: Proximity Verification**

Proximity Verification is Relay's innovative solution to the Sybil attack problem—ensuring that each account represents a unique human by requiring real-world physical presence during onboarding. This mechanism creates a web of trust anchored in physical reality while maintaining privacy and security.

**Why Proximity Matters:**

Physical proximity verification solves multiple critical problems in digital communities:

1. **Sybil Resistance**: Prevents one person from creating multiple accounts
2. **Human Verification**: Confirms that accounts represent actual humans
3. **Trust Anchoring**: Establishes foundation for web of trust
4. **Community Integration**: Creates meaningful social connections
5. **Geographic Relevance**: Connects users to their local community

**Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// Multi-method proximity verification system
async function verifyProximity(meetingCode, inviter, invitee) {
  // Start multiple verification methods in parallel
  const results = await Promise.all([
    verifyBluetooth(inviter.deviceId, invitee.deviceId),
    verifyWifiFingerprint(inviter.location, invitee.location),
    verifyGpsCoordinates(inviter.coordinates, invitee.coordinates),
    verifyAudioBeacon(meetingCode)
  ]);
  
  // Calculate confidence score from multiple signals
  const confidenceScore = calculateConfidenceScore(results);
  
  // Require manual confirmation from both parties
  const inviterConfirmed = await requestConfirmation(inviter.id, meetingCode);
  const inviteeConfirmed = await requestConfirmation(invitee.id, meetingCode);
  
  // Create immutable verification record
  if (confidenceScore >= THRESHOLD && inviterConfirmed && inviteeConfirmed) {
    const verificationRecord = {
      inviter: inviter.id,
      invitee: invitee.id,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      location: anonymizeLocation(invitee.coordinates),
      confidenceScore,
      methods: results.filter(r => r.success).map(r => r.method)
    };
    
    // Record to blockchain for permanent verification
    await recordProximityVerification(verificationRecord);
    return { success: true, record: verificationRecord };
  }
  
  return { success: false, reason: determineFailureReason(results) };
}
```

**Real-World Presence Confirmation:**

```

**Proximity Detection Methods:**
- **Bluetooth Low Energy**: Precise distance measurement (1-30 meter accuracy)
- **WiFi Fingerprinting**: Location verification through network signatures
- **GPS Coordination**: Coarse location verification (10-50 meter accuracy)
- **Camera QR Scanning**: Visual proximity confirmation
- **Audio Beacons**: Ultrasonic proximity signals (works even in noisy environments)

**Bob's Experience:**
When Bob is invited to Relay by Alice, they arrange to meet at a local coffee shop. Once there, Bob's phone automatically detects Alice's device through Bluetooth and ultrasonic signals. Both receive a notification to confirm they're meeting in person. After confirmation, Bob's account status changes from "Provisionally Verified" to "Community Verified," unlocking full participation rights in Relay's local governance. The entire verification takes less than 30 seconds, but creates a cryptographically verifiable proof of their in-person meeting.

#### **Step 8: Trust Network Initialization**

Trust Network Initialization establishes a user's initial position in Relay's social graph—a critical foundation for reputation, discovery, and security systems. Unlike traditional social networks where connections are binary, Relay's trust network uses a sophisticated cryptographic system that captures nuanced relationships while respecting privacy.

**The Trust Network System:**

1. **Cryptographic Trust Proofs**: Trust relationships are established through signed attestations
2. **Multi-Dimensional Trust**: Relationships have context, strength, and directional components
3. **Privacy-Preserving Graph**: Users control visibility of their connections
4. **Zero-Knowledge Discoverability**: Find connections without revealing social graph
5. **Sybil Protection**: Account verification level determined by trust network position

**Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// Trust relationship initialization
async function initializeTrustNetwork(userId, inviterId) {
  // Create first trust connection with inviter
  const initialTrustRelation = {
    source: inviterId,
    target: userId,
    trustContext: 'invitation',
    trustLevel: 'direct',
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    attestations: ['identity', 'proximity']
  };
  
  // Sign and record the trust relationship
  const signedTrustProof = await signTrustProof(
    inviterId,
    initialTrustRelation
  );
  
  // Record to trust graph
  await trustGraph.addRelationship(signedTrustProof);
  
  // Discover potential connections (mutual friends)
  const potentialConnections = await discoverMutualConnections(
    userId, 
    inviterId,
    { privacyPreserving: true }
  );
  
  // Calculate initial trust metrics
  const trustMetrics = await calculateInitialTrustMetrics(userId);
  
  return {
    initialConnection: signedTrustProof,
    potentialConnections,
    trustScore: trustMetrics.score,
    networkStrength: trustMetrics.strength
  };
}
```

**Building Your Trust Network:**
```
Building Your Trust Network:
├─ Connect with inviter as first trust relationship
├─ Discover mutual connections through privacy-preserving protocols
├─ Establish anonymous trust scores based on network position
├─ Initialize reputation system participation
└─ Configure privacy settings for trust data sharing
```

```

**Bob's Experience:**
After meeting Alice for proximity verification, Bob's trust network begins to form. Alice becomes his first trust connection with an initial trust score. Bob discovers that Alice is connected to Carol and David, whom Bob already knows outside of Relay. The system suggests these as potential connections but respects privacy boundaries—Bob can't see Alice's full network, only mutual connections. As Bob confirms these relationships, his trust score increases from 55 to 75, reflecting his established position within a web of verified connections. This higher trust score gives him access to more community features and governance participation.

```

### **Phase 7: Governance Preparation**

#### **Step 11: Civic Identity Verification**

Civic Identity Verification creates a privacy-preserving link between a user's Relay identity and their real-world geographic presence, enabling meaningful participation in local governance while preventing multiple voting accounts. This system uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify residency without storing personally identifiable information.

**Regional Governance Innovation:**

Relay's approach to local governance solves critical challenges in digital democracy:

1. **Local Relevance**: Ensures decisions are made by actual community members
2. **Sybil Resistance**: Prevents multiple voting accounts in local governance
3. **Privacy Protection**: Verifies residency without storing personal documents
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets legal requirements while protecting privacy
5. **Democratic Access**: Creates verifiable civic participation rights

**Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// Privacy-preserving civic identity verification
async function verifyCivicIdentity(userId, documentType, encryptedDocument) {
  // Document verification service with zero-knowledge proofs
  const verificationService = getCivicVerificationService();
  
  // Create secure verification session
  const verificationSession = await verificationService.createSession({
    userId,
    documentType,
    regionRequired: getUserRegion(userId),
    preservePrivacy: true
  });
  
  // Upload encrypted document to verification service
  // Document never stored unencrypted
  const uploadResult = await verificationService.processDocument(
    verificationSession.id,
    encryptedDocument

**Carol's Experience:**
Carol has just moved to San Francisco and wants to participate in local community decisions through Relay. She completes the civic identity verification by taking a photo of her utility bill. The system analyzes the document, confirms her San Francisco residency, and then immediately deletes the document image after verification. Carol receives confirmation that she's now verified as a San Francisco resident, which gives her access to vote on local proposals affecting her neighborhood. She can see that the verification is valid for one year, after which she'll need to reconfirm her residency.

#### **Step 12: Token Allocation and Voting Rights**

Relay's dual-token system creates a balanced approach to democratic participation and network growth. The system combines vote tokens (for governance) with invite tokens (for network growth) to create a Sybil-resistant ecosystem where democratic participation scales with community trust.

**Democratic Token Economics:**

The token system implements several key innovations:

1. **Separate Purpose Tokens**: Different tokens for different platform functions
2. **Trust-Based Access**: Governance participation requires verified identity
3. **Generational Decay**: Prevents exponential network growth that could weaken verification
4. **Engagement Incentives**: Additional tokens earned through positive community participation
5. **Progressive Access**: New users gradually gain more governance weight as trust increases

**Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// Token allocation during onboarding
async function allocateInitialTokens(userId, inviterId) {
  // Get inviter's remaining invite tokens
  const inviterTokens = await tokenService.getInviteTokens(inviterId);
  
  // Calculate invite tokens with generational decay
  const inviteTokenAllocation = Math.max(1, inviterTokens - 1);
  
  // Standard vote token allocation for new users
  const voteTokenAllocation = 20;
  
  // Create token transactions
  const transactions = await Promise.all([
    tokenService.allocateTokens(userId, 'invite', inviteTokenAllocation, {
      reason: 'initial_allocation',
      source: inviterId,
      decayFormula: 'generational_linear'
    }),
    
    tokenService.allocateTokens(userId, 'vote', voteTokenAllocation, {
      reason: 'initial_allocation',
      restrictionPhase: 1,
      maturityPeriod: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 30 days
    })
  ]);
  
  // Deduct invite token from inviter
  await tokenService.deductTokens(inviterId, 'invite', 1, {
    reason: 'invitation_used',
    beneficiary: userId
  });
  
  // Record token allocation to blockchain
  await blockchainService.recordTokenAllocations(transactions);
  
  return {
    inviteTokens: inviteTokenAllocation,
    voteTokens: voteTokenAllocation,
    transactions
  };
}
```

**Your Two-Token System:**
```
Initial Allocations:
├─ Vote Tokens: 20 (democratic participation)
├─ Invite Tokens: Determined by generational decay from your inviter
└─ Additional bonuses from verification steps
```

**David's Experience:**
When David completes onboarding through Carol's invitation, he receives 20 vote tokens for governance participation. Since Carol had 3 invite tokens remaining, David receives 2 invite tokens based on the generational decay formula. David explores his vote token interface and learns that his initial 20 tokens can be used for voting on proposals in channels he joins. The system explains that after 30 days of active participation, he'll graduate to "Trusted User" status, where his voting power will be based on his community standing and participation rather than a fixed token amount.
