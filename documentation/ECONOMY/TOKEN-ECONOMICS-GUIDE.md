# Token Economics Guide

## Executive Summary

Relay's token economy creates a revolutionary economic system that rewards authentic human connection, democratic participation, and community building rather than financial speculation or manipulation. Through carefully designed incentive structures, the system ensures that economic rewards flow to those who contribute genuine value to the network while preserving privacy and preventing extractive behaviors.

This comprehensive token ecosystem supports democratic governance, sustainable community growth, and authentic human verification through four interconnected token types: RELAY tokens for governance and transactions, Vote tokens for democratic participation, Reputation Credits for community building, and Channel tokens for local economies.

# *What this means for users:* Earn real economic value by being a good community member, participating in governance, and helping others - not through speculation or manipulation.

## Economic Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Value Creation over Speculation**
- Rewards for actual network contribution rather than financial manipulation
- Long-term incentives favor sustained positive behavior
- Anti-speculation mechanisms prevent purely extractive participation

**Privacy-Preserving Economics**
- Economic activity doesn't compromise user privacy
- Zero-knowledge proofs for reputation-based rewards
- Anonymous participation in economic activities when desired

**Community-Centric Design**
- Economic benefits flow to community builders and maintainers
- Governance tokens distributed based on positive community participation
- Collective ownership of network value and decision-making

**Sustainable Growth**
- Economic model designed for long-term network health
- Inflation mechanisms tied to actual utility and adoption
- Anti-concentration measures prevent wealth accumulation in few hands

## Token Types and Functions

### RELAY Token (Primary Network Token)

**Primary Functions**
```yaml
Governance Rights:
  - Network parameter voting
  - Protocol upgrade decisions
  - Resource allocation choices
  - Community standard setting

Economic Utility:
  - Transaction fee payments
  - Premium feature access
  - Channel creation deposits
  - Guardian bonding requirements

Staking Mechanisms:
  - Network security participation
  - Validator node operation
  - Governance proposal deposits
  - Trust network backing
```

**Distribution Mechanisms**
- **Community Contribution**: Earned through valuable network participation
- **Network Security**: Rewards for running infrastructure and validation
- **Governance Participation**: Tokens for active and thoughtful governance
- **Creator Economy**: Compensation for content creation and curation

### Vote Tokens (Two-Phase Democratic Participation)

**System Design Philosophy**
- **Phase 1 (New Users)**: Limited tokens earned through network growth and engagement
- **Phase 2 (Trusted Users)**: Unlimited voting with only channel-specific decay rules
- **Security**: Separate from invite tokens which use generational decay for Sybil resistance

**Phase 1: New User Token Earning (First ~30 Days)**
```yaml
Initial Allocation: 20 vote tokens

Earning Opportunities (No Caps - Motivation Rewarded):
  Friend Added: +5 tokens
  Channel Joined: +3 tokens  
  Daily Engagement: +2 tokens (once per day)
  Biometric Verification: +5 tokens
  Guardian Setup: +5 tokens
  Successful Invite: +2-10 tokens (random reward)

Graduation Requirements:
  - Trust Score: >= 75
  - Channels Joined: >= 3
  - Days in System: >= 7
  - Biometric Verified: True
  - Guardian Setup: True
```

**Phase 2: Trusted User (Unlimited Voting)**
```yaml
Vote Capacity: Unlimited
Earning: No longer needed
Decay: Only channel-specific vote decay parameters
Security: Flagging system for suspicious activity only

Flagged User Restrictions:
  Vote Limit: 10 tokens until trust restored
  Invite Tokens: Frozen
  Restoration: Automatic when anomaly patterns clear
```

**Invite Tokens (Separate Security System)**
```yaml
Purpose: Onboard new users (Sybil attack prevention)
Allocation: Generational decay tree (parent - 1, minimum 1)
Regeneration: No - finite resource by design
Security: One-time use, prevents mass account creation
```

**Generational Decay Mechanics**
The number of invite tokens you receive depends on your inviter's generational position:
- **Generation 0 (Founders)**: Start with 10 invite tokens
- **Generation 1**: Receive 9 invite tokens (founder - 1)
- **Generation 2**: Receive 8 invite tokens (gen 1 - 1)
- **Generation N**: Receive max(1, 10 - N) invite tokens
- **Minimum Floor**: Everyone gets at least 1 invite token

**Example Generational Tree:**
```
Alex (Founder, Gen 0): 10 invite tokens
├── Bob (Gen 1): 9 invite tokens  
│   ├── Carol (Gen 2): 8 invite tokens
│   └── Dave (Gen 2): 8 invite tokens
└── Eve (Gen 1): 9 invite tokens
    └── Frank (Gen 2): 8 invite tokens
        └── Grace (Gen 3): 7 invite tokens
```

This ensures exponential growth control while maintaining network accessibility.

## Real-World Economic Scenarios

### Scenario 1: College Student Building Community
**Maya** is a college student who joins Relay to connect with her campus community and earns tokens through authentic participation:

**Month 1-2 (New User Phase)**: Maya starts with 20 vote tokens and earns additional tokens by joining her dorm's proximity channel (+3), adding friends from her classes (+5 each), and completing biometric verification (+5). Her consistent daily engagement (+2 daily) and successful invitation of her study group (+2-10 each) builds her token balance.

**Month 3+ (Trusted User Phase)**: After graduating to unlimited voting, Maya focuses on building Reputation Credits by moderating her major's academic channel, organizing study sessions, and creating valuable study guides. Her REP accumulation unlocks premium features and increases her earning multipliers.

**Economic Impact**: Maya earns enough RELAY tokens to pay for premium features while building valuable reputation that benefits her academically and professionally. The economic incentives align with behaviors that strengthen her real-world community.

### Scenario 2: Local Business Owner Creating Value
**Carlos** owns a neighborhood restaurant and uses Relay's economic system to build community engagement:

**Channel Creation**: Carlos invests 100 RELAY tokens to create "Carlos's Kitchen Community" proximity channel, establishing a community hub for his restaurant that serves his actual business needs.

**Community Building**: He earns Channel tokens through active moderation (+20-100 daily), quality content about local events (+5-50 per post), and growing his community (+100-500 for milestones). His authentic engagement with customers creates both economic and business value.

**Revenue Integration**: Carlos offers loyalty rewards through channel tokens, creates local event coordination that drives business, and builds reputation that attracts new customers. The economic system supports his real business rather than extracting value from it.

### Scenario 3: Governance Participant Earning Through Democracy
**Dr. Liu** is a public policy expert who earns tokens through thoughtful governance participation:

**Proposal Creation**: Dr. Liu creates well-researched governance proposals about privacy standards, earning 100 RELAY tokens for proposals that pass quality review and 500 additional tokens when they're implemented. Her expertise creates network value that's economically rewarded.

**Voting Excellence**: Her consistent, well-researched voting earns REP through research quality bonuses, and her ability to build consensus on complex issues earns additional reputation multipliers. Her governance participation creates both personal economic benefit and network improvement.

**Professional Integration**: Dr. Liu's reputation in Relay governance enhances her real-world professional standing, creating a virtuous cycle where her expertise benefits the network and her career simultaneously.

## Privacy-Preserving Economics

### Anonymous Economic Participation
- **Zero-Knowledge Rewards**: Earn tokens and reputation without revealing personal information
- **Anonymous Transactions**: Economic activity can be completely private while maintaining fraud prevention
- **Reputation Privacy**: Build reputation without exposing the specific activities that earned it
- **Selective Disclosure**: Choose when and how to reveal economic achievements

### Economic Privacy Protections
- **No Financial Surveillance**: Economic activity patterns cannot be used to infer personal information
- **Confidential Balances**: Token holdings are private unless voluntarily disclosed
- **Anonymous Governance**: Vote and participate in governance without revealing identity
- **Private Contributions**: Support causes and communities without exposure of political or social preferences

### Anti-Exploitation Economics
- **No Manipulation Markets**: Token systems designed to prevent pump-and-dump schemes and manipulation
- **Authentic Value Creation**: Economic rewards tied to genuine community contribution rather than financial engineering
- **Anti-Speculation Mechanisms**: Long-term incentives favor sustained positive behavior over short-term extraction
- **Community Protection**: Economic design prevents wealthy actors from capturing disproportionate influence

### Wealth Distribution Safeguards
- **Anti-Concentration Measures**: Diminishing returns prevent excessive wealth accumulation
- **Democratic Access**: Everyone can earn tokens through contribution regardless of initial financial resources
- **Progressive Mechanics**: System designed to reduce rather than amplify existing economic inequalities
- **Community Ownership**: Network value accrues to participants rather than external shareholders

# *Economic benefit:* Earn real value through positive community contribution while maintaining complete economic privacy and protection from exploitation.
