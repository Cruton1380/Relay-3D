## Core Concepts

### Three-Layer Channel Hierarchy
- **Proximity Channels**: Location-based communities (coffee shops, neighborhoods, buildings) with physical verification
- **Regional Channels**: Geographic governance areas (cities, states, regions) with democratic boundaries
- **Global Channels**: Universal access communities (development, coordination, policies) with global participation

### Topic Row Competition System
All decisions use an advanced left-to-right candidate ranking system where options compete for the #1 position through community voting, requiring stabilization periods before implementation. This system enables democratic evolution of all platform parameters.

### Advanced Two-Token Economy
- **Invite Tokens**: Security-critical tokens for user onboarding with generational decay and sophisticated anti-Sybil protection
- **Vote Tokens**: Democratic participation tokens with unlimited earning potential for verified users, enabling full community governance

### Blockchain-Secured Democracy
All governance decisions, economic transactions, and channel evolution are secured through hashgraph consensus with zero-knowledge privacy preservation, ensuring transparency without compromising user privacy.

### Founder-Led Community Genesis
Communities are established through a sophisticated founder system that enables organic growth while preventing centralization, with automatic transition to full democracy as communities mature.

- **Communication Privacy**: End-to-end encryption for all user communications with forward secrecy
- **Participation Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs enable participation verification without identity disclosure

**Data Minimization Principles**:
```javascript
// Example of privacy-first data structure
const userProfile = {
  // Public information (user-controlled)
  displayName: "Community Member",
  bio: "Local resident interested in sustainable living",
  joinDate: "2025-06-01",
  
  // Cryptographic identifiers (no personal data)
  publicKey: "0x1a2b3c4d...", // For verification only
  communityRoles: ["voter", "contributor"], // Functional roles only
  
  // Explicitly excluded personal data
  // realName: undefined, // Never stored
  // email: undefined, // Never stored
  // phoneNumber: undefined, // Never stored
  // biometricData: undefined, // Never stored
  // preciseLocation: undefined, // Never stored

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I join Relay?**
A: Download the Relay app, complete biometric verification (which stays on your device), and discover communities through proximity signals or regional access. The entire onboarding process takes 2-5 minutes.

**Q: Do I need to provide personal information?**
A: No. Relay uses biometric verification for identity without collecting personal information. Your biometric data never leaves your device, and we don't store names, emails, phone numbers, or other identifying information.

**Q: How do I find communities to join?**
A: Relay automatically detects proximity channels when you're near WiFi networks or Bluetooth beacons. You can also join regional channels based on your location or discover global channels based on your interests.

### Privacy and Security

**Q: How does Relay protect my privacy?**
A: Relay uses zero-knowledge proofs, local biometric processing, and end-to-end encryption. Your biometric data, location information, and personal communications are never accessible to Relay servers or other users without your explicit consent.

**Q: Can other users see my real identity?**
A: No. Relay uses cryptographic identifiers instead of real names or personal information. You can participate in communities anonymously or choose to share information selectively based on your preferences.

**Q: How secure is the voting system?**
A: Relay uses cryptographic voting systems that prevent vote buying, manipulation, and fraud. All votes are recorded on the blockchain with zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring integrity while maintaining voter privacy.

### Community and Governance

**Q: How do communities make decisions?**
A: Communities use democratic processes including discussion, proposal creation, and voting. Different communities may use different voting methods (ranked choice, approval voting, consensus) based on their preferences and needs.

**Q: Can community leaders abuse their power?**
A: Community leadership is limited by democratic oversight, transparent governance, and automatic power transitions. Founders have time-limited privileges, and all major decisions require community approval.

**Q: How do token economics work?**
A: Relay uses two tokens: Invite tokens for controlled growth and security, and Vote tokens for democratic participation. You earn Vote tokens through quality participation and community contribution, with no earning caps.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What devices support Relay?**
A: Relay works on iOS, Android, and desktop platforms. Biometric verification requires devices with biometric sensors (fingerprint, face recognition, or equivalent), and proximity features require WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities.

**Q: Does Relay work offline?**
A: Some features work offline, including proximity signal detection and viewing cached content. However, real-time communication, voting, and blockchain operations require internet connectivity.

**Q: How does Relay handle data backup and recovery?**
A: Relay uses a guardian system for account recovery. You select trusted contacts who can help recover your account if you lose access. All recovery is done without exposing your personal information or biometric data.
