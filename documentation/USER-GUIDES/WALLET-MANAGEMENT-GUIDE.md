### What Makes Relay's Wallet Different?

Traditional digital wallets focus on storing and transferring money. Relay's wallet goes far beyond this, serving as a complete financial ecosystem that connects decentralized earnings opportunities with traditional financial systems.

### The Unified Economy Approach

Instead of managing separate accounts for different activities, Relay unifies all your financial interactions into one comprehensive system. Your storage provision earnings flow to the same place as your channel donations and contract payments, while automatic categorization and tax reporting handle the complexity behind the scenes.
