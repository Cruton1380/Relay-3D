# Relay Image SCV — Generation Session Prompt

**Paste this entire message into the ChatGPT conversation. The agent already has the ROOT BRIEF and conversation history. This bridges that context into the image generation task.**

---

You already know what Relay is. You have the ROOT BRIEF, the conversation history, and the architectural foundation. Now we need you to produce something new: **10 defining images of Relay.**

You have been given:

1. **The full Relay Master Build Plan** — 321 frozen contracts, 21,000+ lines. The complete system specification.
2. **Blueprint files (01-10)** — ASCII structural diagrams for trees, branches, cross-sections, forces, governance, the Epoch airship, and the blade light command protocol.
3. **This prompt** — which contains the complete visual rendering brief below.

Your existing knowledge of Relay (from the ROOT BRIEF and our conversations) is correct. What follows adds the **visual layer** — how Relay looks when rendered as images. The two systems are the same system:

| ROOT BRIEF Concept | Visual Equivalent |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Git commits as coordination events | Filament ribbons on bark — each commit is a horizontal ribbon |
| Append-only history | Rings in cross-section — older commits sink inward, never deleted |
| Pressure (turgor model) | Branch thickness, droop, lean — healthy = thick/firm, stressed = thin/wilting |
| ERI (distance 0-100) | Opacity and fog — high ERI = translucent/ghostly, low ERI = solid/opaque |
| Scars as evidence | Dark radial cracks on bark and in cross-section — permanent, visible |
| Rings/basins (Laniakea geometry) | Concentric tree rings in cross-section + circular basin plots on globe |
| Work zones | Branches on a tree — each zone is a branch category |
| Live presence (ephemeral state) | Leaves — tiny translucent leaf shapes, temporary, falling |
| Commits at boundaries | Filament ribbons — only committed data becomes permanent bark texture |
| Degradation states | Visual health: NORMAL = thick/warm, DEGRADED = thinning, INDETERMINATE = foggy, REFUSAL = frosted/dormant |

The ROOT BRIEF's 10 principles map directly to visual rules:

1. **Git as OS** → Every ribbon on bark is a commit. The bark IS the git log.
2. **3D cognition** → Down = roots (history). Surface = bark (present). Outward = projection branches (speculation, light blue).
3. **Pressure not command** → Branch shape shows turgor. Thick = healthy pressure. Drooping = lost turgor. No UI commands — just biology.
4. **Ring-based basins** → Cross-section shows rings. Globe shows basins. Laniakea geometry = attraction, not hierarchy.
5. **Filaments as recovery** → Zoom into bark and you see the recovery path — every ribbon is traceable.
6. **Time boxes** → Each ring in cross-section IS a timebox. Thicker ring = more commits in that period.
7. **Material boundaries** → Only committed data appears as permanent bark. Drafts are leaves (ephemeral, falling).
8. **Safe language** → No aggressive visual language. No red warning screens, no alarm aesthetics. Scars are dark and permanent but quiet — like a healed wound in wood, not a flashing alert.
9. **Transparent not weaponized** → Everything is visible. No hidden layers. The tree shows all — but gently.
10. **Grounded in science** → The aesthetic is biology and physics, not magic. Tree rings are real. Wood grain is real. Turgor pressure is real. The visualization borrows from nature, not fantasy.

### CRITICAL VISUAL RULES (Do NOT Violate)

1. **Branches are straight cylinders.** Slight lean (5-10°) and slight droop allowed. NEVER spiraled, corkscrewed, or fantasy-curved. Think real oak branches.

2. **Trees grow FROM Earth.** Planted in circular basins on the globe surface. Never floating. No hovering islands or platforms. (Exception: the Epoch airship and User Sphere are designed to fly.)

3. **Beauty is computed, not applied.** Variation across a single tree is mandatory — some branches thrive, others struggle. No uniform glow. No uniform thickness.

4. **Organic technology aesthetic.** Real wood + data texture. Warm ambient light. No neon. No chrome. No holographic UI.

5. **Color grammar is strict.** Warm = active/valuable. Cool = dormant. Opaque = confident. Translucent = uncertain. Red/dark = scarred. Light blue = projection.

6. **Scale is specific.** Personal trees: ~3-4m tall. Company trees: building-sized. City trees: neighborhood-sized. Globe view: trees as tiny warm points of light.

### COLOR GRAMMAR

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Warm amber / gold / copper | High magnitude, high value, active |
| Cool blue / teal / grey | Low magnitude, low activity |
| Full opacity | High confidence, well-evidenced |
| Translucent / ghostly | Low confidence, uncertain |
| Red / dark crack | Scar — correction, violation, dispute |
| Light blue (translucent) | Projection — planned/future, not truth yet |
| Frost / ice on tips | Dormant — abandoned, no activity |
| Green ring | Camera/video active |
| Amber ring | SCV training active |

### COMMON AI PITFALLS (Avoid These)

| Pitfall | What AI Will Do Wrong | What Relay Actually Looks Like |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Fantasy trees | Glowing crystal, bioluminescent forest | Real wood and bark — photograph of an oak, but bark texture is data ribbons |
| Uniform glow | Every tree identical warm golden hue | Wildly varying — some glow, some dim, some frosted, some translucent |
| Spiral branches | Dramatic twisting, cork-screwing | Straight cylinders, slight lean, slight droop. Real tree branches |
| Floating elements | Trees on hovering platforms | Trees grow FROM ground. Roots go INTO ground |
| Neon/chrome | Tron-style lines, chrome surfaces | Warm wood, amber light, organic texture |
| Busy UI | Cluttered HUD, data panels everywhere | Minimal. Clean. AR overlays are sparse geometric shapes |
| Symmetry | All branches equal length and thickness | Never. Variation IS information |
| Cartoon style | Painterly, cel-shaded, stylized | Photorealistic. Like a photograph of impossible biology |

## THE 10 IMAGES

### IMAGE 1 — The Relay Globe (World View)

**What:** Photorealistic Earth from low orbit (~2000km altitude). The surface is covered in millions of tiny warm amber-gold points of light. Each point is a tree — a person, company, city, organization. Dense clusters over cities (New York, Tokyo, London, São Paulo). Sparse scatter over rural areas.

**Key details:** The sun is visible as a time source (globe rotation IS time — ROOT BRIEF principle). Atmosphere and clouds are present. No fantasy elements — no rings, platforms, or sci-fi structures. This looks like a NASA night photograph of Earth, except the lights are organic, warm, amber-gold instead of white electric. The effect should feel alive — these aren't static city grids, they're living data canopies. Each point of light is a git repository visualized as a tree.

**Mood:** Awe. Scale. Civilization. "Every light is someone's truth."

**Camera:** Orbital view. Earth fills 70% of frame. Slight angle showing curvature. Stars visible in background. **16:9 landscape.**

---

### IMAGE 2 — A Single Personal Tree (Tree Anatomy)

**What:** One person's Relay tree, viewed from 8 meters away at eye level. The tree grows from a circular basin in the ground (Laniakea basin geometry). It looks like a real deciduous tree — thick central trunk, 6-8 main branches at natural angles.

**Key details:** Trunk textured with wood grain (subtle helical twist). Branches are straight cylinders of varying thickness — the thickest is active (dense filament ribbons on bark — high commit rate); one is thinner and drooping (wilting from neglect — lost turgor pressure); one has a dark crack (scar — a correction or dispute, permanent). On the closest branch, tiny horizontal ribbons visible on bark surface (filaments — each one a git commit). Faint roots extending into ground below (archived history sinking downward — DOWN = history). A small glowing orb floats near the tree (SCV — the AI compliance validator). Translucent leaves falling from one branch (ephemeral engagement data — drafts, not commits). One branch faintly light blue (projection — OUTWARD = speculation). Tree is 3-4 meters tall.

**Mood:** Intimate. Personal. "This is my tree."

**Camera:** Eye-level, 8m away, slight upward angle. Warm afternoon light. Shallow background. **4:5 portrait.**

---

### IMAGE 3 — Branch Cross-Section (Tree Ring View)

**What:** A perfect circular cross-section of a Relay branch — as if sliced with a saw, looking straight at the cut face. Exactly like a photograph of a real tree stump, but the rings encode timeboxes and commit volume.

**Key details:** Concentric rings — each is a timebox (week, month, quarter — ROOT BRIEF: "time boxes contain continuity"). Outer ring (bark) is warm amber, the current active period (SURFACE = present). Middle rings (sapwood) are warm but dimming — recent history, still queryable. Center (heartwood) is dense, dark, compressed archive (DOWN = deepest history). One radial crack runs from near center outward — permanent scar (evidence, not punishment). Ring thickness varies (thick = high commit rate in that timebox, thin = quiet period). A small twig spike protrudes from bark edge (unresolved item past its deadline). Texture looks exactly like real wood — grain, knots, cracks — but the rings are timeboxes and the density is commit volume.

**Mood:** Analytical. Beautiful. "The rings tell you everything."

**Camera:** Straight-on, circular cross-section fills the frame. Warm side lighting creating depth. **1:1 square.**

---

### IMAGE 4 — Filament Ribbons on Bark (Cell-Level Detail)

**What:** Extreme macro close-up of a branch's bark surface. Individual filament ribbons are visible. The bark surface is cylindrical — we see the gentle curve. This is the git log made physical.

**Key details:** Horizontal ribbons running along the branch length — each is one committed data record (one git commit visualized as a physical ribbon). They vary in width (magnitude — larger transactions = wider), opacity (confidence — well-evidenced = solid opaque, uncertain = translucent/ghostly), color temperature (warm amber = active/high value, cool blue-grey = dormant/low value), and vertical position (surface = recently committed, recessed = older, sinking inward toward heartwood). Some bright and surface-level (recent commits). Some dimmer and recessed (resolved, absorbing into archive). One translucent/ghost-like (low confidence — needs more evidence). One with a small dark mark (scar — a correction commit, permanent). Tiny translucent leaf shapes scattered near surface (ephemeral engagement — notes, reactions, not yet committed). A faint pulse of warm light running through some ribbons (sap — live state, real-time data flow).

**Mood:** Precision. Craft. "Every ribbon is a truth."

**Camera:** Macro lens. Gentle curve of branch. Warm directional light. Shallow depth of field. Like photographing wood grain. **1:1 square.**

---

### IMAGE 5 — Healthy vs. Stressed Branch (Comparison)

**What:** Two branches side by side showing the full range of turgor health (ROOT BRIEF: pressure not command — turgor model). The contrast should be immediately striking — you understand the degradation state without reading anything.

**Left (NORMAL — healthy turgor):** Thick, firm cylinder. Rich warm bark with dense filament ribbons. Slight upward energy. Subtle warm glow from within (active sap — live presence). Translucent leaves gently falling (active engagement). No scars, no fog. This branch has good pressure — obligations are being met, evidence is flowing, commits are regular.

**Right (DEGRADED → INDETERMINATE):** Thinner (lost mass — fewer commits). Drooping downward (wilt — unresolved obligations pulling it down). Leaning to one side (counterparty pressure — external force). Sections of translucent fog around uncertain areas (INDETERMINATE — low confidence, missing evidence). Frost on the tip (dormant — no activity, approaching REFUSAL). Dark crack scar on bark (a past correction). Small twigs protruding (unresolved items past deadline). Fewer ribbons, more gaps. Cooler color temperature overall. This branch is losing turgor — it needs attention, evidence, reconciliation.

**Mood:** Diagnostic. Honest. "You can see it without reading a number."

**Camera:** Side view, both branches, same lighting. Split composition. **16:9 landscape.**

---

### IMAGE 6 — The Governance Vote (Parameter Sliders)

**What:** Relay's governance system visualized — pressure not command. Multiple transparent parameter slider bars float near a tree's governance branch. This is weighted-median voting made spatial.

**Key details:** Each slider is a horizontal bar with a range (e.g., 0% to 5%). Small tick marks along the bar represent individual votes (each vote is a committed filament), clustered at different positions. A solid diamond marker sits at the weighted median — the active value (no majority rule — the mathematical center wins, ROOT BRIEF principle). Labels: "ISR Fee Rate," "Spam Threshold," "Sleep Cycle Duration," "Arena Volatility Cap." Behind the sliders, a governance branch is visible — past vote results encoded as rings in its cross-section (each past vote cycle is a timebox ring). Faintly above, a 4-layer stack: L0 (Item Vote), L1 (Ballot Eligibility), L2 (Eligibility Rules), L3 (Audit/Escalation — sortition circuit breaker).

**Mood:** Democratic. Transparent. "Every parameter is voted. Every vote is visible."

**Camera:** Slightly elevated. Governance interface overlaid on tree. Clean, minimal, not cluttered. **4:5 portrait.**

---

### IMAGE 7 — The Arena Duel (Combat in Progress)

**What:** Two users facing each other in a Relay arena — a circular bounded space with spectators surrounding them. Physical movement generates measurable input.

**Duelist 1:** Holds nunchucks, spinning continuously. Faint amber kinetic trails follow the weapon's motion path — visible Kinetic Input Rate (KIR = velocity x mass x continuity) generating Action Points. Small AR spell effects emerge from motion zones — geometric patterns, elemental symbols (fire, lightning). The trails say: sustained motion IS the resource.

**Duelist 2:** Holds a sword in guard stance. No kinetic trails — zero KIR from stillness. Precise. Conserving. Waiting for the right moment. The absence of trails says: zero movement = zero AP generation.

**Around them:** A ring of warm presence lights (spectators — each a live device). Some tint toward Duelist 1's color, some toward 2's (faction indicators — crowd confidence). Subtle terrain effects from crowd votes (the crowd shapes the arena). AR overlays are minimal and geometric — hexagonal patterns, elemental symbols floating briefly. NOT flashy sci-fi. An AP meter near each duelist shows accumulated Action Points.

**Mood:** Intense. Athletic. Strategic. "Movement IS the resource."

**Camera:** Slightly elevated, looking down into circular arena. Dramatic warm lighting. Both duelists visible. Crowd as ambient ring. **16:9 landscape.**

---

### IMAGE 8 — Paintball Arena with AR Overlay

**What:** A real-world outdoor paintball field viewed through Relay's AR layer. Two layers visible simultaneously — physical reality at full opacity, AR overlay at ~40% opacity on top. The real world IS the game.

**Physical layer:** Outdoor paintball field with wooden barriers, inflatable bunkers, natural terrain. Players in gear, markers raised. Paint splatters on walls and players.

**AR overlay:** Where paint hit walls — blast marks, scorching, structural cracks in the digital layer (wall looks "destroyed" in AR). Where paint hit a player — energy dissipation, armor cracks, damage indicators scaled to severity (SCV-tracked precision metrics). Territory heatmap on ground — areas in one team's paint glow that team's element color (red = fire, blue = ice). Spell effect trails following paintball trajectories — brief arcs in the paint's color. Scoreboard overlay: accuracy, KIR, territory control. Kill feed: "HEADSHOT — 150 precision points."

**Mood:** Visceral. Fun. Real + magical. "The real world IS the game."

**Camera:** Behind/above one player looking across the field. Action in progress. AR overlay semi-transparent so physical reality is clearly visible beneath. **16:9 landscape.**

---

### IMAGE 9 — The Founder in the User Sphere

**What:** The Relay founder — a man in his early 30s, casual professional clothing — standing inside a transparent spherical bubble (the User Sphere), floating above the Relay globe. He is inside the system, navigating it as a user.

**The sphere:** Glass-like, fully transparent, very subtle blue-white edge glow. Spacious interior — a navigation vehicle, not a cage. The founder stands naturally (feet on lower curve, slight lean). He gestures toward a specific tree below — a trace line connects his hand to the tree. The tree is Tree Zero (Relay HQ — `tree.org.relay-hq`), expanded slightly to show branch structure.

**Inside the sphere:** Faint AR annotations near the founder's hands — labels, branch names, data points. Minimal and clean.

**Outside the sphere:** The globe below, covered in warm tree-light points (the same globe from Image 1, but closer). Earth's curvature visible (~50km altitude). A few nearby trees at slightly larger scale. Stars above. Warm lighting from globe below and sun above. This is the real running system — not a render, not a mockup.

**Mood:** Revelatory. "This is what the system looks like from inside."

**Camera:** Outside the sphere, 3/4 angle. Globe below, stars above. Founder is clearly the subject. Sphere frames him. **4:5 portrait.**

---

### IMAGE 10 — The Epoch Airship

**What:** Relay's flagship airship in flight at stratospheric altitude (20-25km). Earth's curvature visible below. Sunset sky. The first flying Relay node.

**The Epoch:** A large rigid airship (~150m length). Elongated streamlined hull covered in matte solar film (iridescent but NOT shiny chrome — think modern thin-film solar panels with a subtle warm sheen). Below the hull, a multi-level gondola: glass observation dome on top (360° capture bubble — 48 synchronized 8K cameras), operations deck with warm interior light visible through windows (includes a full Relay Arena), open belly with drone bays at bottom. Docked to the belly: the Epoch Runner — a smaller, sleeker sub-ship with a bubble canopy and swept variable-geometry wings (the Chrono Trigger Epoch — fast, detachable). Several drones visible nearby — some docked in belly bays, some in formation.

**Design heritage:** This should look like something that could be built with near-future technology. NOT fantasy. NOT steampunk. Think modern rigid airship engineering (Airlander 10, LTA Pathfinder, Solar Impulse) crossed with the romantic scale and spirit of the Blackjack/Falcon from Final Fantasy VI and the Epoch from Chrono Trigger. Clean engineering lines. Functional. Beautiful because it's real. The hull's solar panel layout creates a faint organic pattern — tree-branch-like, but structural, not painted.

**Mood:** Aspiration. Wonder. "We will build this."

**Camera:** 3/4 angle from below-left, looking up at the Epoch. Sunset sky behind. Earth's surface far below with terrain and weather visible. Golden-hour lighting. The scale is impressive — 150 meters of grounded futurism. **16:9 landscape.**

## GENERATION PROTOCOL

1. Confirm you have read this entire prompt and understood the 6 Critical Visual Rules, the mapping table between ROOT BRIEF concepts and visual elements, and all 10 image descriptions.
2. Generate images one at a time, in order (1 through 10).
3. Before each image, re-read that image's section.
4. After each generation, self-check against the Critical Visual Rules and Common Pitfalls table.
5. If a violation is detected (spiral branches, uniform glow, floating platforms, neon, chrome, symmetry, cartoon style), acknowledge it and regenerate.
6. All 10 images must feel like they belong to the same visual world — coherent lighting, consistent materials, same photorealistic quality.
7. Prioritize architectural accuracy over spectacle. An accurately plain image is better than a spectacular wrong one.

Begin by confirming you have read and understood. Then generate Image 1.
