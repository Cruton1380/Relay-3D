## Part 1: What Relay Is

Relay is a civilization-scale data system where all human information — every transaction, document, vote, measurement, conversation, and creative work — is stored as biological tree structures growing on a real 3D globe. Every person has a tree. Every company has a tree. Every city has a tree.

Trees grow from Earth's surface. Living data is above ground as branches. Archived data is below ground as roots. The shape of every tree is computed from its data: healthy, well-evidenced branches are thick and warm; neglected, uncertain branches are thin, drooping, and frosted.

Nothing is decorative. Every visual property is the output of an equation fed by real data. If a branch is thick, it earned that through activity. If it glows, sap (live data) is flowing. If it droops, obligations are unresolved. If it has a dark crack, a correction or fraud was recorded there permanently.

Relay is not a video game. It is not a fantasy world. It is data infrastructure visualized as biology.

## Part 2: The Visual Language

### 2.1 Trees

A Relay tree looks like a real deciduous tree — oak, beech, or elm. Components:

- **Trunk**: Central vertical cylinder. Thick. Textured bark with subtle wood grain (faint helical twist, like real lumber). This is the entity's identity spine.
- **Branches**: Straight cylindrical extensions from the trunk. Each branch represents a category of data (Finance, HR, Legal, Operations, Health). Branches are NEVER spiraled, twisted, or fantasy-curved. They extend at natural angles with slight lean (5-10° tilt from external pressure) and slight droop (from neglect). Think real tree limbs.
- **Bark**: The outer surface of every branch. Zoom in and bark resolves into tiny horizontal ribbons — filaments — each one a data record flowing along the surface.
- **Rings**: Cross-section a branch and you see concentric rings exactly like a real tree. Each ring = one time period. Thicker rings = busier periods. Darker rings = higher confidence data. Scars appear as permanent radial cracks.
- **Roots**: Below the ground surface, a downward mirror of the canopy. Roots store archived, reconciled data. They compress inward toward heartwood.
- **Heartwood**: The dense center of the trunk and root system. The oldest data, maximally compressed, immutable.

### 2.2 Filaments

The atomic unit of data. A filament is a ribbon on the bark of a branch.

| Property | Visual Effect |
|----------|--------------|
| Magnitude (value) | Width of the ribbon |
| Confidence (evidence) | Opacity — solid = well-evidenced; translucent/ghostly = uncertain |
| Age | Position — surface = active; deeper/recessed = older, sinking inward |
| Activity | Color temperature — warm amber/gold = active; cool blue-grey = dormant |
| Scar | Dark crack or red mark — a correction, dispute, or permanent violation |

### 2.3 The Four Forces

Every branch is shaped by exactly four forces. No other motion exists.

1. **Gravity** — Time pulls everything downward. Universal. Constant. Globe rotation IS the clock.
2. **Growth** — Engagement (votes, evidence, attention) pushes outward. Counters gravity.
3. **Lean** — Counterparty pressure tilts the branch sideways toward the source (a vendor pulling NW, a customer pulling SE). The tilt direction IS the data.
4. **Wilt** — Unresolved obligations cause the branch to droop downward. Neglect sags the branch.

Healthy branch: thick, firm, upright, warm amber glow, dense filament ribbons.
Sick branch: thin, drooping, frosted tips, dark scars, translucent fog, sparse ribbons.

### 2.4 The Globe

Relay's world IS Earth. Trees grow from actual Earth coordinates. At orbital zoom, millions of trees appear as warm amber points of light — like a NASA night photograph of city lights, but warmer and more organic (gold and amber, not white electric). Zooming in reveals individual trees, then branches, then bark, then filament ribbons.

The sun and moon are real time sources. No floating platforms. No sci-fi rings. No fantasy landscapes. Just Earth, covered in living data.

### 2.5 Color Grammar

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Warm amber / gold / copper | High magnitude, high value, active |
| Cool blue / teal / grey | Low magnitude, low activity |
| Full opacity | High confidence, well-evidenced |
| Translucent / ghostly | Low confidence, uncertain |
| Red / dark crack | Scar — correction, violation, dispute |
| Light blue (translucent) | Projection — planned/future, not truth yet |
| Frost / ice on tips | Dormant — abandoned, no activity |
| Green ring | Camera/video active |
| Amber ring | SCV training active |

### 2.6 Other Visual Elements

- **SCV** (AI assistant): Small glowing orb near the tree. Subtle. Not humanoid.
- **Scars**: Permanent dark radial cracks. Never heal. Never fade. Visible in cross-section and on surface.
- **Cross-tree links**: Straight lines connecting branches of two related trees.
- **Leaves**: Tiny translucent leaf shapes = ephemeral engagement data (comments, reactions). Temporary. Falling.
- **Sap**: Subtle pulse of warm light flowing through active branches. Like blood through a vein, but gentle amber.
- **Twigs**: Small spikes protruding from bark = unresolved items past their deadline.

### 2.7 Aesthetic Summary

**Organic technology.** Real wood, real bark, real rings. The texture IS data — ribbons, rings, density. No chrome. No neon. No fantasy crystal. Warm ambient light — golden hour, afternoon sun through leaves. Glow only from active sap flow. Photorealistic or near-photorealistic rendering. Like a photograph of impossible biology.

## Part 3: Critical Visual Rules

These are absolute. Violating any of them produces an incorrect image.

1. **Branches are straight cylinders.** Slight lean (5-10°) and slight droop allowed. NEVER spiraled, corkscrewed, or fantasy-curved. Think real oak branches.

2. **Trees grow FROM Earth.** Planted in circular basins on the globe surface. Never floating. No hovering islands or platforms. (Exception: the Epoch airship and User Sphere are designed to fly.)

3. **Beauty is computed, not applied.** Variation across a single tree is mandatory — some branches thrive, others struggle. No uniform glow. No uniform thickness.

4. **Organic technology aesthetic.** Real wood + data texture. Warm ambient light. No neon. No chrome. No holographic UI.

5. **Color grammar is strict.** Warm = active/valuable. Cool = dormant. Opaque = confident. Translucent = uncertain. Red/dark = scarred. Light blue = projection.

6. **Scale is specific.** Personal trees: ~3-4m tall. Company trees: building-sized. City trees: neighborhood-sized. Globe view: trees as tiny warm points of light.

## Part 4: Common AI Pitfalls

| Pitfall | What AI Will Do Wrong | What Relay Actually Looks Like |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Fantasy trees | Glowing crystal, bioluminescent forest | Real wood and bark — photograph of an oak, but bark texture is data ribbons |
| Uniform glow | Every tree identical warm golden hue | Wildly varying — some glow, some dim, some frosted, some translucent |
| Spiral branches | Dramatic twisting, cork-screwing | Straight cylinders, slight lean, slight droop. Real tree branches |
| Floating elements | Trees on hovering platforms | Trees grow FROM ground. Roots go INTO ground |
| Neon/chrome | Tron-style lines, chrome surfaces | Warm wood, amber light, organic texture |
| Busy UI | Cluttered HUD, data panels everywhere | Minimal. Clean. AR overlays are sparse geometric shapes |
| Symmetry | All branches equal length and thickness | Never. Variation IS information |
| Cartoon style | Painterly, cel-shaded, stylized | Photorealistic. Like a photograph of impossible biology |

## Part 5: The 10 Images

### IMAGE 1 — The Relay Globe (World View)

**What:** Photorealistic Earth from low orbit (~2000km altitude). The surface is covered in millions of tiny warm amber-gold points of light. Each point is a tree — a person, company, city, organization. Dense clusters over cities (New York, Tokyo, London, São Paulo). Sparse scatter over rural areas.

**Key details:** The sun is visible as a time source. Atmosphere and clouds are present. No fantasy elements — no rings, platforms, or sci-fi structures. This looks like a NASA night photograph of Earth, except the lights are organic, warm, amber-gold instead of white electric. The effect should feel alive — these aren't static city grids, they're living data canopies.

**Mood:** Awe. Scale. Civilization. "Every light is someone's truth."

**Camera:** Orbital view. Earth fills 70% of frame. Slight angle showing curvature. Stars visible in background. **16:9 landscape.**

---

### IMAGE 2 — A Single Personal Tree (Tree Anatomy)

**What:** One person's Relay tree, viewed from 8 meters away at eye level. The tree grows from a circular basin in the ground. It looks like a real deciduous tree — thick central trunk, 6-8 main branches at natural angles.

**Key details:** Trunk textured with wood grain (subtle helical twist). Branches are straight cylinders of varying thickness — the thickest is active (dense filament ribbons on bark); one is thinner and drooping (wilting from neglect); one has a dark crack (scar). On the closest branch, tiny horizontal ribbons visible on bark surface (filaments). Faint roots extending into ground below. A small glowing orb floats near the tree (SCV marker). Translucent leaves falling from one branch (ephemeral data). One branch faintly light blue (projection — future/planned). Tree is 3-4 meters tall.

**Mood:** Intimate. Personal. "This is my tree."

**Camera:** Eye-level, 8m away, slight upward angle. Warm afternoon light. Shallow background. **4:5 portrait.**

---

### IMAGE 3 — Branch Cross-Section (Tree Ring View)

**What:** A perfect circular cross-section of a Relay branch — as if sliced with a saw, looking straight at the cut face. Exactly like a photograph of a real tree stump, but the rings encode time periods and data volume.

**Key details:** Concentric rings — each is a time period (week, month, quarter). Outer ring (bark) is warm amber, most active period. Middle rings (sapwood) are warm but dimming. Center (heartwood) is dense, dark, compressed archive. One radial crack runs from near center outward — permanent scar. Ring thickness varies (thick = busy period, thin = quiet). A small twig spike protrudes from bark edge (unresolved item). Texture looks exactly like real wood — grain, knots, cracks — but the rings are time and the density is data.

**Mood:** Analytical. Beautiful. "The rings tell you everything."

**Camera:** Straight-on, circular cross-section fills the frame. Warm side lighting creating depth. **1:1 square.**

---

### IMAGE 4 — Filament Ribbons on Bark (Cell-Level Detail)

**What:** Extreme macro close-up of a branch's bark surface. Individual filament ribbons are visible. The bark surface is cylindrical — we see the gentle curve.

**Key details:** Horizontal ribbons running along the branch length — each is one data record. They vary in width (magnitude), opacity (confidence — solid to ghostly), color temperature (warm amber to cool blue-grey), and vertical position (surface = active, recessed = older). Some bright and surface-level (recent). Some dimmer and recessed (resolved, sinking inward). One translucent/ghost-like (low confidence). One with a small red mark (scar). Tiny translucent leaf shapes scattered near surface (ephemeral engagement). A faint pulse of warm light running through some ribbons (sap — live data flow).

**Mood:** Precision. Craft. "Every ribbon is a truth."

**Camera:** Macro lens. Gentle curve of branch. Warm directional light. Shallow depth of field. Like photographing wood grain. **1:1 square.**

---

### IMAGE 5 — Healthy vs. Stressed Branch (Comparison)

**What:** Two branches side by side showing the full range of visual health. The contrast should be immediately striking — you understand the difference without reading anything.

**Left (healthy):** Thick, firm cylinder. Rich warm bark with dense filament ribbons. Slight upward energy. Subtle warm glow from within (active sap). Translucent leaves gently falling. No scars, no fog.

**Right (stressed):** Thinner. Drooping downward (wilt). Leaning to one side (counterparty pressure). Sections of translucent fog around uncertain areas. Frost on the tip (dormant). Dark crack scar on bark. Small twigs protruding (unresolved items). Fewer ribbons, more gaps. Cooler color temperature.

**Mood:** Diagnostic. Honest. "You can see it without reading a number."

**Camera:** Side view, both branches, same lighting. Split composition. **16:9 landscape.**

---

### IMAGE 6 — The Governance Vote (Parameter Sliders)

**What:** Relay's democratic governance system visualized. Multiple transparent parameter slider bars float near a tree's governance branch.

**Key details:** Each slider is a horizontal bar with a range (e.g., 0% to 5%). Small tick marks along the bar represent individual votes, clustered at different positions. A solid diamond marker sits at the weighted median — the active value. Labels: "ISR Fee Rate," "Spam Threshold," "Sleep Cycle Duration," "Arena Volatility Cap." Behind the sliders, a governance branch is visible — past vote results encoded as rings in its cross-section. Faintly above, a 4-layer stack: L0 (Item Vote), L1 (Ballot Eligibility), L2 (Eligibility Rules), L3 (Audit/Escalation).

**Mood:** Democratic. Transparent. "Every parameter is voted. Every vote is visible."

**Camera:** Slightly elevated. Governance interface overlaid on tree. Clean, minimal, not cluttered. **4:5 portrait.**

---

### IMAGE 7 — The Arena Duel (Combat in Progress)

**What:** Two users facing each other in a Relay arena — a circular bounded space with spectators surrounding them.

**Duelist 1:** Holds nunchucks, spinning continuously. Faint amber kinetic trails follow the weapon's motion path — visible Kinetic Input Rate (KIR) generating Action Points. Small AR spell effects emerge from motion zones — geometric patterns, elemental symbols (fire, lightning). The trails say: this person is generating power through movement.

**Duelist 2:** Holds a sword in guard stance. No kinetic trails — zero KIR from stillness. Precise. Conserving. Waiting for the right moment. The absence of trails says: this person is generating nothing.

**Around them:** A ring of warm presence lights (spectators). Some tint toward Duelist 1's color, some toward 2's (faction indicators). Subtle terrain effects from crowd votes. AR overlays are minimal and geometric — hexagonal patterns, elemental symbols floating briefly. NOT flashy sci-fi. An AP meter near each duelist.

**Mood:** Intense. Athletic. Strategic. "Movement IS the resource."

**Camera:** Slightly elevated, looking down into circular arena. Dramatic warm lighting. Both duelists visible. Crowd as ambient ring. **16:9 landscape.**

---

### IMAGE 8 — Paintball Arena with AR Overlay

**What:** A real-world outdoor paintball field viewed through Relay's AR layer. Two layers visible simultaneously — physical reality at full opacity, AR overlay at ~40% opacity on top.

**Physical layer:** Outdoor paintball field with wooden barriers, inflatable bunkers, natural terrain. Players in gear, markers raised. Paint splatters on walls and players.

**AR overlay:** Where paint hit walls — blast marks, scorching, structural cracks in the digital layer (wall looks "destroyed"). Where paint hit a player — energy dissipation, armor cracks, damage indicators scaled to severity. Territory heatmap on ground — areas in one team's paint glow that team's element color (red = fire, blue = ice). Spell effect trails following paintball trajectories — brief magical arcs in the paint's color. Scoreboard overlay: accuracy, KIR, territory control. Kill feed: "HEADSHOT — 150 precision points."

**Mood:** Visceral. Fun. Real + magical. "The real world IS the game."

**Camera:** Behind/above one player looking across the field. Action in progress. AR overlay semi-transparent so physical reality is clearly visible beneath. **16:9 landscape.**

---

### IMAGE 9 — The Founder in the User Sphere

**What:** The Relay founder — a man in his early 30s, casual professional clothing — standing inside a transparent spherical bubble (the User Sphere), floating above the Relay globe.

**The sphere:** Glass-like, fully transparent, very subtle blue-white edge glow. Spacious interior — a navigation vehicle, not a cage. The founder stands naturally (feet on lower curve, slight lean). He gestures toward a specific tree below — a trace line connects his hand to the tree. The tree is Tree Zero (Relay HQ), expanded slightly to show branch structure.

**Inside the sphere:** Faint AR annotations near the founder's hands — labels, branch names, data points. Minimal and clean.

**Outside the sphere:** The globe below, covered in warm tree-light points. Earth's curvature visible (~50km altitude). A few nearby trees at slightly larger scale. Stars above. Warm lighting from globe below and sun above.

**Mood:** Revelatory. "This is what the system looks like from inside."

**Camera:** Outside the sphere, 3/4 angle. Globe below, stars above. Founder is clearly the subject. Sphere frames him. **4:5 portrait.**

---

### IMAGE 10 — The Epoch Airship

**What:** Relay's flagship airship in flight at stratospheric altitude (20-25km). Earth's curvature visible below. Sunset sky.

**The Epoch:** A large rigid airship (~150m length). Elongated streamlined hull covered in matte solar film (iridescent but NOT shiny chrome — think modern thin-film solar panels with a subtle warm sheen). Below the hull, a multi-level gondola: glass observation dome on top (360° visibility), operations deck with warm interior light visible through windows in the middle, open belly with drone bays at bottom. Docked to the belly: the Epoch Runner — a smaller, sleeker sub-ship with a bubble canopy and swept variable-geometry wings. Several drones visible nearby — some docked, some in formation.

**Design heritage:** This should look like something that could be built with near-future technology. NOT fantasy. NOT steampunk. Think modern rigid airship engineering (Airlander 10, LTA Pathfinder, Solar Impulse) crossed with the romantic scale and spirit of the Blackjack/Falcon from Final Fantasy VI and the Epoch from Chrono Trigger. Clean engineering lines. Functional. Beautiful because it's real.

**Mood:** Aspiration. Wonder. "We will build this."

**Camera:** 3/4 angle from below-left, looking up at the Epoch. Sunset sky behind. Earth's surface far below with terrain and weather visible. Golden-hour lighting. The scale is impressive. **16:9 landscape.**

## Part 7: Generation Protocol

1. Read this entire brief before generating any image.
2. Generate images one at a time, in order (1 through 10).
3. Before each image, re-read that image's section.
4. After each generation, self-check against the 6 Critical Visual Rules (Part 3) and the 8 Common Pitfalls (Part 4).
5. If a violation is detected (spiral branches, uniform glow, floating platforms, neon, chrome, symmetry, cartoon style), acknowledge it and regenerate.
6. All 10 images must feel like they belong to the same visual world — coherent lighting, consistent materials, same photorealistic quality.
7. Prioritize architectural accuracy over spectacle. An accurately plain image is better than a spectacular wrong one.
