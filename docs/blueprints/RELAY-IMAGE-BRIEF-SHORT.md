# Relay Image Brief

Relay: all human data stored as biological trees on a real 3D globe. Every person, company, city has a tree. Trees grow from Earth. Living data = branches above ground. Archive = roots below. Shape is computed from data: thick/warm = healthy, thin/drooping/frosted = neglected. Nothing decorative. Every visual property = equation output.

## Rules (Never Violate)

1. Branches are STRAIGHT cylinders. Slight lean (5-10°), slight droop. Never spiraled/fantasy-curved.
2. Trees grow FROM Earth in circular basins. Never floating. No sci-fi platforms.
3. Beauty is computed. Variation mandatory — some branches thrive, others struggle. No uniform glow.
4. Organic technology. Real wood + data texture. No neon, chrome, holographic UI.
5. Color: warm amber = active. Cool blue = dormant. Opaque = confident. Translucent = uncertain. Dark crack = scar. Light blue = projection.
6. Scale: personal trees ~3m. Company trees = building-sized. Globe view = amber light points.

## Pitfalls

Fantasy/crystal trees → use real wood. Uniform glow → vary wildly. Spiral branches → straight. Floating → grounded. Neon → warm amber. Busy UI → minimal. Symmetry → never. Cartoon → photorealistic.

## The 10 Images

**1. RELAY GLOBE (16:9)** — Earth from orbit, millions of warm amber-gold light points (each = a tree). Dense over cities, sparse rural. Like NASA night photo but organic gold, not white electric. Sun visible. Clouds present. No fantasy. "Every light is someone's truth."

**2. PERSONAL TREE (4:5)** — One tree, 8m away, eye-level. Circular basin. 6-8 branches, varying thickness. Thickest = active (dense bark ribbons). One thin/drooping (neglect). One dark-cracked (scar). Bark shows tiny horizontal filament ribbons. Faint roots below. Small glowing SCV orb. Translucent falling leaves. One light-blue projection branch. 3-4m tall. Warm afternoon light.

**3. CROSS-SECTION (1:1)** — Branch sliced like a tree stump. Concentric rings = time periods. Outer ring warm amber (current). Middle rings dimming (recent history). Center dark/dense (archive). One radial crack = scar. Thick rings = busy periods. Twig spike on edge = unresolved item. Real wood texture — grain, knots, cracks. Warm side lighting.

**4. FILAMENT MACRO (1:1)** — Extreme close-up of bark. Horizontal ribbons = data records. Vary in width (magnitude), opacity (confidence: solid→ghostly), color (warm amber→cool grey), position (surface=recent, recessed=old). One translucent ghost ribbon. One red-marked scar. Tiny translucent leaves. Faint warm pulse = sap (live data). Macro lens, shallow depth of field.

**5. HEALTHY vs STRESSED (16:9)** — Side by side. Left: thick, firm, warm bark, dense ribbons, subtle glow, falling leaves, no scars. Right: thinner, drooping, leaning, fog sections, frosted tip, dark crack, protruding twigs, fewer ribbons, cooler color. Same lighting both sides. Contrast = immediate.

**6. GOVERNANCE VOTE (4:5)** — Transparent parameter sliders near a governance branch. Each slider: horizontal bar, tick marks = individual votes, diamond at weighted median. Labels: "ISR Fee Rate," "Spam Threshold." Branch behind shows past votes as rings. Faint 4-layer stack above: L0 Item, L1 Eligibility, L2 Rules, L3 Audit. Clean, minimal.

**7. ARENA DUEL (16:9)** — Circular arena. Duelist 1: nunchucks spinning, amber kinetic trails, AR spell effects (geometric, elemental). Duelist 2: sword in guard, zero trails (stillness = zero power). Crowd = ring of warm lights with faction tints. Subtle terrain from crowd votes. Minimal AR overlays. AP meters. Elevated camera.

**8. PAINTBALL AR (16:9)** — Real paintball field + 40% opacity AR overlay. Physical: barriers, players, paint splatters. AR: blast damage on walls, armor cracks on players, territory heatmap (red fire/blue ice), spell trails on trajectories, scoreboard, "HEADSHOT — 150 precision points." Behind/above one player. Reality clearly visible beneath.

**9. FOUNDER SPHERE (4:5)** — Man (early 30s, casual professional) inside transparent glass sphere floating above globe. Sphere: subtle blue-white edge glow, spacious. Gestures toward Tree Zero below with trace line. Faint AR labels near hands. Globe with tree-lights below, curvature visible, stars above. 3/4 angle outside sphere. "This is what the system looks like from inside."

**10. EPOCH AIRSHIP (16:9)** — 150m rigid airship, stratospheric altitude. Hull: matte solar film (iridescent, not chrome). Multi-level gondola: glass dome top, operations middle, drone bays bottom. Epoch Runner sub-ship docked below (bubble canopy, swept wings). Drones in formation. Near-future engineering, not fantasy. Airlander 10 meets FF6 Blackjack. 3/4 below-left angle, sunset, golden hour.

## Protocol

Generate one at a time, in order. Self-check against rules after each. Regenerate on violation. Coherent visual world across all 10. Accuracy over spectacle.
