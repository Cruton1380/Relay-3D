## Series II — Visual Atlas (11-21)

Structural diagrams covering the full system from cosmic scale to file-level mapping. Designed as a composable atlas — each image stands alone, all together form a complete conceptual map.

## Image Generation Package

### Image Generation Correction Brief (PRIORITY — read first):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **[IMAGE-GENERATION-CORRECTIONS.md](IMAGE-GENERATION-CORRECTIONS.md)** | **Specific corrections** based on review of generated images. Identifies what went wrong and provides exact fixes. Read this BEFORE regenerating. |

### For an agent WITH existing Relay conversation history (ROOT BRIEF already loaded):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **[RELAY-IMAGE-SCV-PROMPT.md](RELAY-IMAGE-SCV-PROMPT.md)** | **USE THIS ONE.** Single merged prompt: bridges ROOT BRIEF concepts to visual language, includes mapping table, all 10 image descriptions, rules, pitfalls, and generation protocol. Paste directly into existing ChatGPT session. |

### For a fresh agent with NO prior context:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [CHATGPT-OPENING-PROMPT.md](CHATGPT-OPENING-PROMPT.md) | Opening message for a brand new session |
| [RELAY-IMAGE-BRIEF.md](RELAY-IMAGE-BRIEF.md) | Self-contained brief (~3,200 words) with full system context |
| [CHATGPT-AGENT-SYSTEM-CONTEXT.md](CHATGPT-AGENT-SYSTEM-CONTEXT.md) | Extended system explainer (optional) |
| [CHATGPT-IMAGE-GENERATION-BRIEF.md](CHATGPT-IMAGE-GENERATION-BRIEF.md) | Extended image descriptions (optional) |

### Visual Atlas Section Map

The 11 diagrams in Series II form a navigable architecture atlas:

| Section | Diagrams | Answers |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **I — Cosmic Structure** | 11 (Fractal Stack) | Where does Relay begin and end? |
| **II — Physics Engine** | 12 (Force Field), 13 (Cross-Axis) | How does shape equal meaning? |
| **III — Analysis & Governance** | 14 (Projection), 15 (Governance) | How do we think without mutating truth? Who decides? |
| **IV — Civilization Engine** | 16 (Supply Chain) | How does truth propagate across the world? |
| **V — Immersion Layer** | 17 (Device Mesh), 18 (Arena), 19 (Sport) | How do we inhabit the system? |
| **VI — Infrastructure** | 20 (Epoch), 21 (2D→3D) | How does Relay leave the ground? How does code become geometry? |
| **VII — Economic Substrate** | 22 (Barter Geometry) | How does exchange work beneath the money layer? |
