## 🔍 ALIGNMENT CHECK: V.01 ↔ SCV v2.1

### **Core Concepts (All Present in Both)**

✅ **Three-Way Match**
- V.01: Defines Intent ↔ Projection ↔ Reality as fundamental
- SCV v2.1: Setup command + full explanation + examples

✅ **Turgor Pressure Model**
- V.01: Biological analogy with cells and water pressure
- SCV v2.1: Complete mapping table + mechanical equivalence

✅ **Five Invariants**
- V.01: Lists all five with implementation details
- SCV v2.1: Setup command + enforcement rules + examples

✅ **Filaments**
- V.01: Defines as relationships over time, not files
- SCV v2.1: Explains as commit chains with examples

✅ **3D Spacetime Navigation**
- V.01: Full stack explanation + geometry
- SCV v2.1: Setup command + navigation controls + structure

✅ **ERI (Exposure Readiness Index)**
- V.01: Calculation methods + condition taxonomy
- SCV v2.1: Three-state display + confidence thresholds

✅ **Pressure Loop**
- V.01: 6-step cycle with code examples
- SCV v2.1: Setup command + code + key rules

✅ **Safe Language**
- V.01: Full translation table
- SCV v2.1: Setup command + translation table + enforcement

✅ **Cadence**
- V.01: Defines as verification rhythm
- SCV v2.1: Explains how it adjusts automatically

✅ **Canon vs Branches**
- V.01: Operating consensus, not truth
- SCV v2.1: Timestamped, revisable coordination state

## 🔒 PHILOSOPHY ALIGNMENT

### **Canonical Statement (LOCKED)**

Both documents use the exact same canonical statement:

> "In Relay, every user becomes a coherence operator. Security is not a separate profession; it is continuous verification..."

This is **LOCKED** and unchanged.

### **Safe Language (ENFORCED)**

Both documents enforce the same adversarial language replacement:

| ❌ NEVER SAY | ✅ ALWAYS SAY |
|--------------|---------------|
| attack | audit |
| war-game | verification scenario |
| attacker | coherence operator |
| exploit | exposure precondition |
| breach | exposure condition |
| penetration test | integrity check |

### **Five Invariants (PRESERVED)**

1. **Pressure Budget** (Humane by Design)
2. **Confidence Floor** (Honest by Design)
3. **Repair Effectiveness** (Learning by Design)
4. **Data Minimization** (Private by Design)
5. **Policy Governance** (Governed by Design)

All five are identical in both documents.
