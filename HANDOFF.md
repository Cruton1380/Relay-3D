### Filament Ribbon Renderer (FILAMENT-RIBBON-1)

The filament renderer uses batched `Cesium.Primitive` (one per branch, NOT individual entities) for ribbons. Each filament is a quad strip on the cylindrical bark surface with `(lHead, lTail, theta, r)` extent computed from the filament model. Dots use `Cesium.Entity` points with `CallbackProperty` for live sinking. Twigs use short Entity polylines (few per branch). Ribbons rebuild on `relayAdvanceDays(n)`. Debug controls: `relayForceLOD("BRANCH")` to force ribbon view, `relayAdvanceDays(7)` to advance sim time.

### Unified Camera Controller (CAMERA-CTRL-1) — LOCKED

Replaced `fly-controls.js` + `wasd-fly.js` with single `app/controls/camera-controller.js`. Frozen contracts #134-135 (§50).

- **6DOF FPS flight** (space sim style): WASD fly/strafe, Q/E roll, Space/C ascend/descend, Shift boost, mouse pitch/yaw, scroll speed. No auto-leveling, no auto-correction. Camera is sovereign.
- **Three modes**: ORBIT (Cesium default), FPS (full manual 6DOF), RTS (top-down edge-scroll). Tab cycles.
- **Underground flight**: FPS has no altitude floor. Globe hides below surface. Scene tints amber→red with depth. Geological layer label (TOPSOIL → DEEP MANTLE). NaN recovery via last-good camera snapshot.
- **Geostationary toggle**: H key. Globe rotation ORBIT-only. Geostationary auto-enabled on FPS enter.
- **Basin boundary resistance**: Seven altitude bands (SPACE → CELL). Speed dampening + vignette on crossing.
- **Favorites**: Ctrl+0-9 save, Ctrl+Shift+0-9 recall. Position stack via backquote.
- **HUD**: Bottom-center frosted glass panel (mode badge + altitude/basin + search bar). Keybind hints below. Suggestion toasts above. Underground overlay with depth label.
- **Pointer event isolation**: All pointer events blocked from Cesium in FPS/RTS. setPointerCapture errors eliminated.
- **Keybind rebinding** (planned): All binds stored in a map, user-configurable, with presets. Panel lock mode for 2D interactions (§50.4).
- **Reserved keys**: R, T, 1-9 (no Ctrl) for future interactions.
- Old files `fly-controls.js` and `wasd-fly.js` deleted.

### Scheduling Engine (§5b)

The branch tip IS the calendar. Scheduled events are filaments at future l positions — translucent, physically inert (zero weight in all force equations), anchored at their future time slot. When scheduled time arrives, `SCHEDULED→OPEN` transition fires automatically, the filament solidifies, and gravity/physics engage. Notifications are not a separate system — they are the filament arriving at the present. Meetings, venues, recurring events, and large multi-day events all use this same mechanic. Cancellation is append-only (scar-like commit). Frozen contracts #124-125.

### Business Artifact Mapping (§52) — Frozen Contract #136

Org charts, budget slides, tactical bullet lists, meeting agendas, and mass balance dashboards all map to existing tree measurements. No new physics required. Added §52 to master plan with six canonical mappings:

- **Org hierarchy** = branch nesting geometry. Branch depth = reporting depth. Thickness = activity volume, not headcount.
- **Budget allocation** = magnitude mass per branch. Branch thickness = `Σ magnitude`. Ring thickness = periodic spend. Lean = supplier concentration.
- **Tactical/strategic items** = filament lifecycle states. OPEN/ACTIVE = tactical. SCHEDULED/projection = strategic. HOLD = deprioritized (wilting).
- **Meeting cadence** = timebox cross-section inspection. Monthly = one-month ring on regional branches. Quarterly = quarter ring on all primaries. Agenda = twig list + heat map.
- **Mass balance** = conservation law on branch (contract #136). `inputSum - (outputSum + wasteSum - recycledSum) ≈ 0`. Deviation → ring color shift. Cumulative imbalance → branch lean. Per-timebox, deterministic, replayable.
- **Dashboards** = projection branches (light blue). Filters are client-side view masks. Values trace to source filaments in one click.

Manufacturing operations template (`template.manufacturing.operations.v1`) added to §21.2.1 with `magnitudeType` field (input/output/waste/recycled/byproduct), conservation consolidation gate (2% tolerance), sensor + document evidence rules.

### Canonical Reference: The Tree Photo

The real tree cross-section photo (bark + concentric rings + radial crack + compressed core) is the mechanical blueprint for Relay's rendering model. Every ring = a timebox slab. Every crack = a scar. The bark = the active surface. The dense core = compressed archive. The grain = commit causality. §3.13 and §3.14 formalize this mapping.

### Wind & Weather Physics

Branches move for exactly three reasons: lean (counterparty pressure direction, §3.15), droop (slab wilt, §3.7), and twist (helix period, §3.5). No other motion exists. Wind is not a separate overlay — it is the pattern of branch lean observed during time replay. Weather overlays (heat tiles, fog haze, storm flicker, lightning cascades, §3.16) are deterministic computations from TimeboxAggregate fields cached at timebox close. All lean is explainable to one click. The 10x scale discipline rules (§3.17) define LOD shed order and prevent visual noise at scale.

### Branch Layout (§3.18)

Branch direction (where it points from the trunk) comes from stable `layoutKey` hashing — never from live data, counterparties, or wind. Multi-layer ring shells prevent overlap. Collision-aware deterministic routing handles dense trees. LOD bundle merge collapses 100+ branches into category bundles at TREE LOD. Directory trees use semantic bins (Documents/Media/Projects/Archive/System/Other). Frozen contract #114: layout from identity only.

### Universal Physics Engine (§3.19, §3.20, §33.5)

Ten scale-invariant force equations govern everything from file to Laniakea: radial position (lifecycle), gravity sink (time), lean vector (directional pressure), wilt (integrity deficit), heat (rate of change), fog (uncertainty), storm (danger), lightning (cascade), trunk mass (archive), and scaling law (aggregation). The orbital model (§3.20) maps branches as orbital bodies where perturbations (lean, droop, thickness change) carry meaning. Laniakea LOD (§33.5) defines 11 rendering levels from CELL to LANIAKEA — same equations, different aggregation depth. Frozen contracts #115-117: equations are universal, scaling is aggregation only, no physics above source.

### Angular Disambiguation (§3.5.1)

Six distinct rotational/angular concepts exist and must never be conflated: (1) filament θ (counterparty on bark), (2) branch layoutAngle (identity hash), (3) helix twist (time grain), (4) branch lean (directional pressure), (5) globe rotation (time itself), (6) camera reorientation (UI only). §23.1 wind definition was corrected to align with §3.15 (wind = observed lean during replay, not a computed vector). Equations 1 and 3 updated with SCHEDULED state (r=1.0 bark, stateWeight=0.0 inert).

### Content-Type Temporal Mapping (§3.21, §3.22)

Non-tabular content (documents, code, media, spatial/CAD) requires two independent time axes: `l_content` (position within the content) and `l_time` (calendar time). Gravity always uses calendar-time (universal constant). Only the `primaryAxis` (what l means at CELL LOD) and `inwardTrigger` vary per template. Cross-section rings mean different things per content type: time periods for tabular, edit sessions for documents, versions for code, production sessions for media. Drill-down from ring to content adapts per type. Contract #128: gravity always uses calendar-time.

### Settlement & Evidence Integrity (§31.4, §31.5)

Timebox assignment is always by `spawnAt`, never external `settlementAt`. Settlement confirmation is a commit on the existing filament — it does not change timebox membership. External evidence hashes are Merkle-anchored and immutable; URL expiry does not reduce confidence. Templates define `evidenceArchivePolicy` (CACHE_LOCAL, HASH_ONLY, CACHE_AND_HASH). Contracts #126-127.

### Replay Compression (§48.4.3)

Five-layer strategy for exabyte-scale deterministic replay: (1) per-filament terminal compression (hot/warm/cold levels), (2) per-timebox summary compression (aggregates always full fidelity), (3) cross-timebox delta encoding (~60-80% savings), (4) Merkle checkpoint compaction (every N commits), (5) regional federation sharding. Compression is tree physics applied to itself (Contract #130). Compression never reduces verifiability — every level retains Merkle proofs. Target: current timebox <16ms, 10-year cross-section <5s, full filament drill-down <10s. Contract #129.

### Root System & Heartwood (§1.3)

The root system is the underground mirror of the canopy — alive, governed by the same ten equations, with root lean (retrieval direction), root heat (audit surge), root fog (integrity deficit), root wilt (checkpoint failures). Root growth is semi-proportional to canopy activity. Roots are DIAGNOSTIC ONLY — they never affect canopy physics, lifecycle, governance, or availability (Contract #132). Heartwood is the terminal stillness state: data at compression Level 2, age > threshold, integrity 1.0, negligible retrieval, all checkpoints sealed. Heartwood contributes zero to all equations — just structural mass. Re-expansion only under integrity anomaly, legal demand, or evidence cascade (Contract #133). Heartwood prevents root compute from scaling with total archive size.

### Architecture Status: CLOSED

The architecture is structurally complete, mechanically audited, adversarially stress-tested, economically modeled, scale-verified to 10B users, launch-ready, and revelation-classified. 325 frozen contracts, ~21,000+ lines, 108 top-level sections (§0–§108, plus §5b, §49b, §49c, §74b) across 14 Parts. 60+ precision quotes from universally recognized figures (Franklin, Churchill, Einstein, Aristotle, Lao Tzu, Rachel Carson, Bruce Lee, MLK, Carl Sagan, Butters Stotch, Kandinsky, Alan Kay, Peter Drucker), the founder (Eitan Asulin), AI collaborators (ChatGPT 5.2, Claude Opus 4.6), and Relay itself as a voice open each major section. Includes Table of Contents and Glossary for non-technical readers. Four structural states (canopy, trunk, active roots, heartwood).

**Civilization Coverage (§72-§76, contracts #176-182)**: Layered option governance expanded to 4-layer constitutional engine (§72.7-72.10): Layer 0 item vote, Layer 1 ballot eligibility, Layer 2 eligibility rules, Layer 3 audit/escalation/sortition circuit breaker. Core schemas: BallotItem, MetaVotePacket, EligibilityRuleSet. Deterministic settlement with hysteresis and hard gates. Visual encoding on governance branch (green/amber/red bands). Universal onboarding (live globe, drag-to-tree file mapping, community-governed tutorial master list). Traffic and civic response (CivicAlertPacket, CivicAccessCredit, deterministic dispatch, live traffic flow, degraded civic mode for disasters). Physical weather (3D meteorological rendering from sensors, separate from branch weather, LOD radar-to-cloud, game layer bridge). Civilization template library (13 pillars: PERSON through FIN-INSTRUMENTS; companion doc with HEALTH-1 and PROPERTY-1 deep-dives + JSON stubs in config/templates/).

**Architectural Clarifications (§71, contracts #167-175)**: 20 binding cross-cutting decisions. Privacy operates only on available data. All resources flow everywhere. Unified audience resolution. LATEST_DISPLAY. Jury parameters governance-protected. KMS defined. Closure commits. Entity tree anchors. Per-filament/branch/tree privacy. Credentials as commit record. Arena votes as continuous sliders. Voting always live. LOD inverse-scaling.

**Quote Attribution & Open Annotation (§79, contract #186)**: Every filament supports open annotation by default. Word-level voting via micro-filaments targeting character ranges (agree/disagree/clarify/cite/flag). Suggestions are linked filaments; acceptance grows the original with a new commit. Deferred attribution handles `@whoever` placeholders resolved when the real person claims it. Owner controls lock and grant. Provenance chains auditable. Tree shape is the citation index.

**Product Supply Chain Traceability (§77, contracts #183-184)**: Mineral-to-shelf version control. Every retail product is a tree with design, BOM, batch, distribution, retail, warranty, recall, and environmental branches. Component filaments link recursively to supplier trees, material lots, refineries, and extraction sites. Mass balance enforced at every stage (input = output + waste). Recall propagation via lightning cascade along linked chains. Retail camera overlay shows provenance, carbon intensity, and active risks. **Filament Length Ontology (§78, contract #185)**: Filament length along L-axis emerges from commit topology (commitCount, lifecycleSpan, structuralWeight), not manual assignment. Five emergent profile classes: micro (posts, 1-3 commits), transaction (POs, 5-20 commits), project (books/films, dozens-thousands), structural (balance sheets/directories, never close), continuous (live data feeds, steady flow). Structural nodes are commit aggregators that define branch geometry. Anti-gaming: low semantic delta + high scaffold % → fog, wilt, scar.

**Operational Hardening (§81, contracts #188-196, #294, #296-297)**: Twelve binding operational contracts addressing review-identified gaps: filament kind enforcement (finite vs structural, engine-level), **structural filament compression** (HeartwoodRingSummary — age-based ring compression with Merkle roots: monthly after 1yr, quarterly after 5yr, annual after 20yr; no data deleted, drill-through on demand; contract #294), basin visibility normalization (logarithmic compression at regional LOD), silence-means-stability doctrine (dormant parameters require supermajority to change), offline conflict merge protocol (fork preservation, SCV resolution branch, no "last write wins"), lens read-only invariant (universal prohibition on write from analytic views), template version fork reconciliation (TemplateVersionBridge with field mappings), **TemplateResolvedSpec** (deterministic cross-version resolution via bridge chain composition, monotonically degrading compatibility, fog/broken-bridge rendering for partial/incompatible projections, per-hop confidence penalty; contract #296), minority alarm channel (15% eligibility triggers sortition review on existential changes), conceptual LOD (5-tier progressive disclosure: PERSONAL→TEAM→ORG→CIVIC→CIVILIZATION), first-screen contract (empty tree + 3 starter branches + one guided action, 60 seconds to first value), **Small Tree Mode** (GenesisBundle < 50MB, offline-first boot with low-res globe + 3 branches + T0 SCV + full camera, launch-to-first-filament < 5s, deferred progressive content streaming; contract #297).

**Enforcement Tightening (§50.7, §82.4.1, §82.5.2, §90.7, contracts #291-293, #295)**: Four binding enforcement contracts closing structural ambiguities: **Classification Matrix** (machine-enforceable objectType → layer mapping table per template, engine refuses misclassified commits with CLASSIFICATION_VIOLATION refusal code; contract #291), **Camera Tick Safety** (per-frame NaN validation, last-known-good snapshot recovery, no setView() in FPS/RTS tick loops except 5 enumerated events, position-only altitude clamping, full SSCC disable in manual modes; contract #292), **AirspaceResolvedSpec** (single resolved output object for all rendering subsystems, no raw airspace JSON bypass, global→regional→venue monotonic tightening, one spec per frame with determinism hash; contract #293), **Leaf Promotion Anti-Gaming Gate** (non-self counterparty, non-trivial evidence, or SCV attestation required for every leaf→filament promotion, author excluded from uniqueParticipants count, template declares applicable gate per domain; contract #295).

**Scale Invariance Guarantee (§87, contracts #223-225)**: Proves Relay handles 10 billion daily active users without changing a single equation. Every operation is O(1) per filament or O(scope) bounded by LOD shedding — no operation depends on total system population (contract #223). Federation architecture: regional shards with lightweight Globe Index, cross-region Merkle verification, independent scaling, degraded-mode resilience (contract #224). Day-one load profile: ~100B daily commits, ~5B TransferPackets, ~2B concurrent SapPackets, ~10 PB/day storage growth — all handled by federation + microsharding + TTL-governed ephemeral layers, funded by ISR and resource pricing (contract #225).

**Launch Strategy & Distribution Model (§88, contracts #226-228)**: The ignition plan. Relay ships desktop-first (Electron app, standard installer, no CLI/Git/Node required), web second (invite-gated at relay.world), developer build third on GitHub for transparency (contract #226). Six-phase adoption sequence: Phase 0 = enterprise accountability tool (P2P, HR, Contracts templates), Phases 1-4 = progressive template and platform expansion, Phase 5 = game layer reveal, Phase 6 = full civilization (contract #227). Website is narrative not documentation ("The shape is the audit"), with 90-second films targeting CFOs/auditors/parents/operators. Enterprise wedge: internal audit teams, CFO offices, process-heavy factories, compliance industries. Platform-agnostic: Windows/macOS/Linux desktop at launch, web Phase 2, mobile Phase 3, VR/AR Phase 5 — never requires proprietary hardware (contract #228). Anti-patterns: never lead with arena, cosmic scale, anti-bank theory, or require developer tools.

**Airspace & Atmospheric Elevation Layers (§90, contracts #238-241)**: Six contiguous altitude bands govern what renders at each elevation: GROUND (0-200m, full detail, editing allowed), CANOPY (200-2,000m, local truth work), TREE (2,000-50,000m, management view, read-only), REGION (50,000-2,000,000m, weather/civic overlays, presence quantized), ORBIT (2M-20M m, planetary fields), DEEP (>20M m, interplanetary). Trees exist at all layers — detail is local (contract #238). Each band has a priority budget (truth + lenses + spectacle = 1.0) with frozen shed order: spectacle first, lenses second, detail last; truth silhouettes never shed below TREE (contract #239). Three governance scopes: global MetaVote, regional tightening, venue overrides (hospitals, schools, arenas) — venues can only tighten safety, never weaken (contract #240). Frozen invariants: truth-first shed order, no physics alteration from airspace, presence quantized above REGION, no pay-to-win airspace, contiguous layers, venue safety monotonicity (contract #241). Config stubs: `config/airspace/airspace.global.v1.json`, `config/airspace/airspace.venue.hospital.v1.json`. Implementation: `core/airspace/airspace-types.js`, `core/airspace/airspace-validate.js` with strict validation, binary search lookup, and `[REFUSAL] reason=AIRSPACE_INVALID_SPEC` logging.

**Progressive Revelation & Source Document Architecture (§89, contracts #229-233)**: The Master Build Plan cannot ship unredacted — any AI can extract game layer, spell registry, and governance internals in seconds. Solution: five Revelation Tiers (RT-0 public through RT-4 source vault) with per-tier AES-256-GCM encryption and achievement-gated decryption (contract #229). Sealed branches on Tree Zero show visible geometry but encrypted content — frosted bark with lock glyph (contract #230). RT-0 content ships as standalone Day-1 Starter Pack (`RELAY-STARTER-PACK.md`) with accessible language and no references to hidden content (contract #231). AI Curation Tool assists founder in classifying every artifact, proposing treasure chest placements, generating the starter pack, and validating mystery distribution — runs locally, never transmits source documents (contract #232). Treasure chests (§43.6) extended to contain development history fragments: partial AI transcripts, redacted design sketches, equation derivations, philosophical exchanges. RT-3 unlocks via collective global milestones. RT-4 subdivided into treasure chests, achievement chains, and ultimate reveal (full MBP) via 85% supermajority vote or epoch timeout — eventual full transparency guaranteed. All raw evidence preserved and Merkle-sealed. Collective reveals are permanent and irreversible (contract #233). Updated: §80.2 (genesis commit adds RT classification step), §43.6 (treasure chests contain MBP fragments), §44.3 (day-1 setup includes classified document corpus).

**Infrastructure Sustainment & Treasury Model (§86, contracts #216-222, #234-235)**: Relay's economic sustainment module. Infrastructure Sustainment Rate (ISR): transparent fee on economic TransferPackets only, constitutionally capped at 1.00%, default 0.30% at genesis, community-governed via Layer 3 MetaVote with 70% supermajority (contract #216). Founder bootstrap window: ±0.20% ISR adjustment for first 5 years with mandatory ResponsibilityPacket and visible scar, permanently removed after sunset (contract #217). Branch-level operational rates: fractal pricing where each branch sets its own rate, stacking independently with ISR, healthcare and civic branches constitutionally exempt (contract #218). Resource-based pricing: compute/storage/render metering billed per timebox (contract #219). Treasury transparency: public system tree (`tree.system.relay`) with all revenue and expenses as committed filaments, same physics rendering (contract #220). Accumulation ceiling: auto-triggers ISR reduction vote at 12× annual cost, hard circuit breaker at 24× (contract #221). Pricing invariants: fees never alter governance weight, confidence, lifecycle, or truth commit availability; free-tier access to truth/governance/civic/health/education guaranteed (contract #222). The 0% transition requires 85% supermajority and phases down over 24 months. Emergency legal defense ISR increase (≤ +0.05%) requires MetaVote ratification and auto-expires in 12 months. Treasury template JSON stub: `config/templates/template.relay.system.treasury.v1.json`. Live download pricing: no tiers — single fluctuating price = unfunded operating gap per projected new user, floored at $0, derived from treasury tree filaments and displayed on relay.world with full audit links (contract #234). Crowdfunded operations model: any project tree can adopt the same live gap-based pricing formula — all costs evidence-linked, price updates per timebox, overfunding triggers ceiling, contributors get permanent proof-of-participation filaments; Relay's own download pricing is the first instance of this universal model (contract #235). Genesis contributors: every user who purchases before price hits $0 receives a permanent non-sinking filament on Tree Zero, optional public attribution with personal intent statement, sequential contributor number, and placement in the visually distinct genesis ring — confers no governance weight, confidence, or feature advantage; the honor is the permanent record; contributors follow normal gravity and sink into roots like all history; genesis ring closes with GenesisSealEvent when system becomes self-sustaining (contract #236). Self-hosted development: Tree Zero is a working company tree, not an archive; development transitions from external tools (Cursor/Git) to Relay-internal development in four phases; at maturity, dev branches contain the running system logic; contributions come from Relay-approved users through Relay's own governance; the self-hosting transition is an architectural requirement (contract #237).

**Adversarial Stress Hardening (§85, contracts #208-215)**: Addresses structural, governance, and economic failure modes identified during adversarial review. Projection thrash prevention: cached per timebox boundary using projectionInputHash, mid-timebox commits show staleness indicator (contract #208). Archive strata collapse: four depth tiers (living/warm/cold/heartwood) with deterministic compression and on-demand rehydration (contract #209). Detection mesh legal safeguard: camera output is sap-class by default, no auto-commit without human confirmation (contract #210). Governance quorum: parameters below minimum voter participation freeze until quorum met (contract #211). Jury fatigue prevention: 120-hour annual cap, mandatory sabbatical, annual training requirement (contract #212). Monster economy grounding: reward budget bounded by real-world filament absorption magnitude (contract #213). Anchor allowance anti-gaming: evidence-bearing commits across 3+ branches required, immune detection applies (contract #214). Cross-region feature negotiation: intersection of both regions' feature sets, truth layer never gated (contract #215). Adopted enhancements: civilization energy dashboard (Eq 12 at globe aggregation), structural entropy visualization (fog+wilt as fractal noise, no new metric), scar density heatmap, and optional intentStatement field on filaments.

**Energy Budget (§83, contracts #203-205)**: Closes the equation gap — the 10 universal equations described decay but not growth. Photosynthesis equation (Eq 11): branchGrowthRate = f(promotedLeafMagnitude × confidence × resolutionRate). Energy budget conservation (Eq 12): Δ(branchMass) = photosynthesis − gravity − wilt. Dormancy index (Eq 13): engagementRate vs baseline, four thresholds (active/quiet/dormant/deep), frost visual, compute savings, instant re-engagement. Composite vitality score: confidence × firmness × (1 − dormancy). Immune detection trigger: threshold-based tripwire activating existing response mechanisms (scars, sortition, civic observation) when heat+fog, promotion spam, Sybil patterns, or confidence drops exceed limits.

**Three-Layer Ontology (§82, contracts #197-201)**: Formalizes the biological three-layer data model: Wood (filaments — permanent truth, append-only), Leaf (LeafPackets — ephemeral engagement with TTL, compostable or promotable), Sap (SapPackets — live state with millisecond TTL, overwritable, never persisted without checkpoint). LeafPacket extends §5 Notes as formal successor with richer lifecycle (BUD→ACTIVE→FALLING→COMPOSTED or PROMOTED), eight leaf types (NOTE, COMMENT, REACTION, HINT, DRAFT, PROJECTION_PREVIEW, ARENA_VOTE_INTENT, PING), engagement tracking, and explicit promotion rules (FIRST_REPLY, THRESHOLD, MANUAL, TEMPLATE, NONE). SapPacket carries live operational state (presence, WIP, dispatch, viewing position) separated from truth — architecturally compatible with Contract #138 because sap is not a filament. Promotion from leaf to filament is explicit and auditable. Sap checkpoints to filament only on materiality, duration, external reference, or emergency. Degradation order: sap first, leaves second, wood last. Demotion stress test classifies every record type across the three layers. Visual rendering: leaves as translucent falling objects, sap as branch pulse animations.

**Genesis Record (§80, contract #187)**: The Relay HQ tree (`tree.org.relay-hq`) is Tree Zero — the first tree in the system, created by the founder's genesis commit. All development artifacts (architecture documents, Cursor conversations, code, media, decisions) imported as filaments with original timestamps preserved and Merkle-sealed. Genesis commit sets all extraction rates (transaction commission, regional tax, session tax, CAC) to 0% — community votes these up through parametric governance. SCVs activate at genesis for architecture coherence, code coherence, evidence completeness, pressure balance, and parameter governance. 2D legacy traffic monitoring maps fragmented internet pressure to tree geometry. Full 8-step genesis sequence defined: account creation, tree zero, archive import, parameter initialization, SCV activation, disclosure configuration, genesis seal, first invitation.

**Arena Branches (§68, contracts #161-163)**: Bounded volatility sandbox with crowd-driven terrain voting. ArenaContributionPacket, MTG-style stack resolution, 55+ votable metrics, five match modes. **Certification (§58.12, contract #153)**: Community-governed third-party verification. **Accessibility (§62, contract #154)**: Four interaction layers, WCAG 2.2 AA. **Child Safety (§63, contract #155)**: Age brackets, grooming prevention, COPPA/KOSA/DSA/AADC. **Voice Development (§64, contract #156)**: Every user is a developer. **Compliance (§65, contract #157)**: Cryptographic erasure, CSAM, terrorism pipeline. **Storage (§66, contracts #158-159)**: Microsharding, Shamir, marketplace. **BCP/DRP (§67, contract #160)**: Automated continuity. **Presence Profiles (§8.6, contract #166)**: Contextual identity broadcast. **Self-Descriptors (§8.7, contract #242)**: All identity attributes (gender, religion, ethnicity, profession, etc.) are free-text fields with no predefined categories — user types what they are, system suggests common values (frequency-ranked) but never enforces, every descriptor is optional/owner-written/opt-in searchable, no descriptor affects governance/confidence/equations, no external authority can write to a user's descriptors branch; the category-free identity model eliminates platform-level debates over identity categories. Prior: §61 (#150-152), §60 (#149), §58.7-58.11 (#147-148), §59 (#143-146), §58 (#142), §38 (#141), §57 (#140), §52-§56, §50 (#115-139).

**Filament Color Grammar (§91, contract #243)**: Six-channel visual rendering system mapping universal domains to perceptual channels: hue from identity (object type), angular position from counterparty, L-position from time, color temperature from magnitude (warm=large, cool=small), opacity from evidence/confidence, radial position from lifecycle. Template hue maps are Category B. Channels are perceptually orthogonal. No manual color assignment.

**SCV Intelligence Architecture (§92, contracts #244-246)**: Four-tier routing for SCV intelligence: T0 deterministic (zero cost, no AI), T1 lightweight local model (self-hosted 8B-70B params), T2 frontier API (Anthropic/OpenAI, per-token cost), T3 human escalation (sortition/authority). Every AI invocation produces an AIInvocationFilament recording tier, model, tokens, cost, latency, purpose, and evidence hash — making AI costs visible on the tree. Intelligence sovereignty: truth layer operates with zero AI dependency. Degradation sheds T2 first, T1 second, T0 never.

**Relay HQ Subsidiary Model (§93, contracts #247-248)**: Tree Zero spawns subsidiary trees (Relay Robotics, Relay Education, regional offices) via structural cross-tree filaments. Each subsidiary has a treasury branch where every cost (staff, compute, AI, facilities, equipment, legal, R&D) is a committed filament with evidence. Mission-gated cost reduction: subsidiary budgets do not reduce until mission objectives are 100% complete with confidence above 0.8.

**Civilization Goals (§94, contracts #249-251)**: Six progression tiers (0-5) gate game layer features behind real-world achievements. Goals are structural filaments on Tree Zero's goals branch, with metrics aggregated from bottom-up cross-tree data (never self-reported). Tier 0 = foundation (genesis). Tier 1 = visibility (hunger <5%, literacy >95%, water >95%). Tier 2 = accountability (weather deaths <1K, 50+ transparent governments). Tier 3 = coordination (zero hunger, universal education, justice transparency). Tier 4 = civilization (zero armed conflict, nuclear reduction, ocean plastic reversal). Tier 5 = interplanetary (lunar presence, Mars data). Unlocks are irreversible; regression produces scars not re-locks. Achievement requires confidence >0.8.

**Pricing Model (§95, contracts #252-254)**: Three revenue streams only: ISR (0.30% on TransferPackets, 1% constitutional cap), resource pricing (compute/storage metering), download price (live gap-based, trends toward $0). Free tier is constitutionally permanent: truth commits, governance, civic, health, education, basic tree. No advertising ever. No data sales ever. Revenue must fund all active missions. Accumulation ceiling auto-triggers ISR reduction at 12× annual cost. Pricing competitive with tools Relay replaces at every adoption tier.

**Treasure Chest Taxonomy (§96, contracts #255-256)**: Four chest types defining a scarcity gradient: Type 0 (Open — unlimited, identical content for all), Type 1 (Personal — bound to specific user's tree topology), Type 2 (Regenerating — rotating content from finite pool, goes dormant when exhausted), Type 3 (One-Time — single opening ever, consumed, spawns legendary branch). Sharing mechanics: opening is a filament commit, sharing generates leaf engagement, citations create counterparty links. Attention is engagement mass on the sharer's tree. Chests provide knowledge, never power.

**Legendary Branch (§97, contracts #257-258)**: Unique structural filament with hash-derived geometry spawning only on Type 3 chest opening. Visually unmistakable: unique bark texture, persistent glow, non-template angle, fully formed at spawn. Cannot be transferred, forked, duplicated, wilted, or deleted. Confidence permanently 1.0. Total legendary branches globally bounded by finite Type 3 chest count. Cross-tree viewing follows standard disclosure tiers.

**Founder Archive Distribution (§98, contracts #259-260)**: All founder documentation, video, audio, AI transcripts, design sketches, and philosophical exchanges distributed exclusively as Type 3 one-time chests. Geographic placement thematically linked to content. Temporal scattering with sealed activation schedules. Total chest count is sealed. Archive deliberately too large for any individual to collect. The founder's act of trust: personal history given to the system one fragment at a time, irreversibly.

**The Awakening Curve (§99, contracts #261-262)**: Relay's deepest design principle. Sustained use naturally produces progressive understanding: personal utility → interoperability → supply chain → accountability → civilization metrics → the realization that one universal structure reveals the state of everything. Mirrors the founder's own journey. Cannot be skipped, purchased, forced, or faked. Free tier provides everything needed. Conceptual LOD is the mechanical implementation; the Awakening Curve is the philosophical foundation. The curve is the product.

**The Substrate (§100, contracts #263-266)**: Shared geological knowledge layer beneath all trees — the knowledge commons. Contains reference filaments indexing humanity's existing 2D internet knowledge with full attribution, authority-tier confidence, and deferred claims for original creators. No entity owns it. Activation mechanic: real users commit living filaments that link down to the bedrock, becoming geographic anchors. Anti-gaming rate limits (5 base, scaling with maturity, 50 ceiling, cooldown on immune trigger — all Category A). Original 2D creators claim attribution via deferred claim (§79.4) when they join Relay. Substrate shrinks over time as primary sources supersede references.

**SCV Physical Extension (§101, contracts #267-269)**: The SCV intelligence tier model extends to physical devices — drones, ground robots, marine vehicles, sensors, satellites. Devices are actuators commanded by the SCV; they gather evidence, not make truth claims. Device companion trees with telemetry (sap), maintenance, missions (MissionFilament schema), evidence, and compliance branches. Cross-tree evidence flow carries device-gathered evidence to target branches for SCV validation. Relay Robotics follows a four-phase progression: Protocol (open SDK) → Software (on existing hardware) → Reference Hardware (Relay-native devices) → Fleet Infrastructure (autonomous evidence networks). Software before hardware.

**Search Architecture (§102, contracts #270-273)**: Search is an SCV function — no separate search engine. T0 handles structured queries deterministically, T1/T2 handle natural language and cross-tree discovery. Search queries are constraint sets across six universal domains plus template fields. Filter governance via two-stage meta-vote (§72): community votes on which filters exist and their priority ordering. Search renders as a read-only lens — matching filaments intensify, non-matching fade, cross-tree results show as navigable trace lines. Search telemetry (queries, clicks, navigation) trains T1 local models over time — the path to intelligence sovereignty. The tree graph itself is the richest structured training dataset for native search AI.

**The SphereCore (§103, contracts #274-277)**: The deepest layer — a dense sphere of semantic anchor points at the geometric center of every Relay globe. Each anchor is a language-independent concept (meaning-without-words). Radial connections extend outward from anchors to Earth's surface per language — translation is following one thread inward then another outward. Regional word differences produce separate threads to separate anchors. Categories, templates, and domain labels all trace to SphereCore anchors. ~4,000 genesis anchors seeded from established linguistics. New anchors require community governance. Five-layer depth model: Canopy → Roots → Substrate → SphereCore → Planetary Core. Each celestial body gets its own SphereCore; universal concepts synchronized via cross-core links.

**Conversational Discovery (§104, contracts #278-280)**: Treasure chests can be discovered through natural SCV conversation when the user demonstrates genuine understanding — connecting SphereCore concept anchors through coherent reasoning. Five-signal anti-gaming: semantic coherence (T1/T2 evaluated), tree evidence, Conceptual LOD alignment, multi-turn progressive conversation (min 5 turns), and prerequisite chain. Trigger specifications are sealed. Each evaluation includes user's personal tree state — triggers are non-transferable. Type 3 conversational chests contain founder fragments matching the user's own independent realization.

**Device Mesh & Physical Immersion (§105, contracts #281-284)**: Arbitrary Relay-running devices form a unified rendering surface via proximity discovery, camera registration, and sap-level frame sync. Four topology modes (FLAT/CURVED/SPHERICAL/FREEFORM). Distributed viewport rendering — each device renders its frustum slice locally. Cross-device drag handoff via sap packets. Audio mesh with sub-millisecond speaker sync and spatial audio. Sensor integration (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, camera, microphone, haptics). Immersion spectrum from companion (2 devices) to venue (hundreds). No proprietary hardware. Mesh is temporary. Privacy preserved — joining shares no personal tree data.

**Live Performance Loop (§106, contracts #285-287)**: Audience devices publish engagement sap (movement, attention, presence, reaction, opt-in biometric, opt-in audio). Signals aggregate into CrowdAggregate rendering as a live audience branch on the performer's event tree. Domain applications: DJ reads crowd energy as branch physics, AI music uses aggregate as generation input, theatre uses sentiment for branching narrative, comedy tracks per-joke response, sports quantifies crowd momentum, film A/B tests cuts with scene-level engagement. All metrics aggregate-only, advisory for humans, generative for AI.

**Genesis Party Protocol (§107, contract #288)**: The first public Relay event sequence: QR download + Genesis Film (15 min), three demos — The Tree Is Real, Your Phone Is Part of This, This Is Just the Start (10 min), then four party games: The Dreidel (cross-device physics via accelerometer), The Wave (synchronized color ripple with crowd-governed parameters), The Collective Instrument (AI music with 6 weighted-median attribute sliders across all phones), The Constellation (anonymous interest-based social discovery). Event committed as filaments on Tree Zero. Attendees receive genesis event filaments. Both celebration and proof script.

**Input Device Protocol & Weapon Taxonomy — The Way of the Flowering Humanhood (§43.10, contract #299)**: Open input device system built on the **Command Precision Index (CPI)** — a universal composite metric (signal clarity, semantic density, throughput, resource efficiency) that determines combat effectiveness regardless of weapon choice. Precise commands cost less Power; imprecise commands waste resources. Each user's CPI is unique to their body and device. Nine **Relay Set Weapons** rooted in Hwa Rang Do (화랑도) are founder-optimized with pre-built zone maps: **Empty Hand** (universal, 10+ zones), **Sword** (4 zones, high power), **Nunchaku** (12 zones, combo depth 10, supreme speed), **Staff** (6 zones, max reach + defense), **Knife** (3 zones, close-range speed), **Fan** (5 zones + binary modifier, highest defense), **Rope/Chain** (4 zones, entanglement control), **Spear** (5 zones, max power + reach), **Three-Section Staff** (20 zones, 3 combat modes, internal elemental chambers, founder's weapon, highest capability ceiling). Beyond Set Weapons, the **Open Input Device Protocol** allows ANY object to register as an input device — SCV learns zone maps through training. **Sound as combat modality** (The Bard): musical instruments (flute, violin, drums, guitar, voice) produce pitch/rhythm/harmony/dynamics signals with higher semantic density than physical weapons, enabling sustained effects, crowd manipulation, and stealth commands. **Electronic devices** (keyboard, MIDI, controller) offer extreme throughput and precision. **Ranged weapons** (shuriken, throwing knives, axes, bow) provide burst damage at distance. **The Final Fantasy Principle**: no class is weak — a flautist at CPI 0.92 defeats a swordsman at CPI 0.55, a speed-typist outcasts a spear wielder, a drummer simultaneously deals physical damage and casts audio spells. Street Fighter combo model for body/melee weapons; melodic phrase model for instruments; keystroke sequence model for electronics. All Relay Set Weapon balance values are Category A (community-governed). **Dual-channel signal architecture**: Channel 1 (Commands) = hand signals on tools parsed as zone sequences; Channel 2 (Magnitude) = light, fire, smoke, water detected by camera providing spell power. Channels are independent; using light as both command and magnitude requires high CPI. **Charging attack**: sustained specular reflection builds Power over time, amplified by CrowdAggregate crowd confidence — visible, interruptible, high-risk/high-reward. **Regional/global weapon bonuses**: parametric governance (§72) votes bonus modifiers for specific device types per region/venue, time-bounded, re-votable. All matchmaking and bonus disputes use sortition (§46) with frozen 4:3:3 human randomization ratio. The open protocol, dual-channel signal architecture, CPI metric, and the principle that precision determines power are frozen.

**V93 Safety Primitives & Publish-Readiness Audit (§0.5, §4.8, §10.4, §19.4-19.5, §62.8, §63.7, §82.7b, §92.6, §101.8, contracts #305-310)**: Comprehensive audit of all prior conversations and V93 archive (2,039 files) identified structural primitives present in V93 but missing from the Master Plan. Six new contracts formalize: **Eight Edges of Livability** (§0.5, #305) — eight constitutional guarantees (leave, disagree quietly, wait, lose without burnout, legible history, safe vulnerable, coexisting communities, respected inaction). **Turgor Pressure** (§10.4) — biological naming for wilt physics ("no attacker required for failure, only absence of maintenance"). **Governance Safety Primitives** (§19.4-19.5, #306) — soft divergence (non-blocking disagreement, no pressure consumption, no auto-escalation) and cooling windows (24-168h mandatory delay before irreversible actions, no bypass except emergency dispatch). **Truth Boundary Primitives** (§4.8, §82.7b, §92.6, #307) — STABILITY_CONFIRMED lifecycle resolution (reviewed/no action needed, 60-day cooldown), canon summarization discipline (summaries are projection, must cite sources, cannot be evidence), learning boundary (AI emits POLICY_RECOMMENDATION only, human governance emits POLICY_APPLIED, schema-enforced). **Protected Participation Profiles** (§63.7, #308) — configurable constraint profiles for minors, vulnerable adults, high-risk onboarding, medical recovery, self-requested; engine-enforced visibility/role/load limits. **IoT Ingestion Protocol** (§101.8, #309) — standardized sensor/PLC/meter/camera ingestion with SAP_ONLY, SAP_WITH_CHECKPOINT, and DIRECT_FILAMENT modes. **UI Internationalization** (§62.8, #310) — RTL, CJK, locale formatting, string externalization, community-governed translation quality.

**Graphic Crafting Module & Summon Cards (§43.11-43.12, contracts #311-312)**: The Crafting Module provides an integrated IDE (image, video, sound, music, composite generators) where users design their own visual combat language. All generators free for unlimited testing; finalization commits graphics as permanent filaments consuming crafting resources scaled by rarity tier (Common → Legendary). Legendary crafting requires treasure chest discoveries and achievement prerequisites. Graphics link to specific skills/spells — the visual IS the language. Anti-fraud: only Crafting IDE outputs can finalize (no external imports). Summon Cards are autonomous AI entities (not graphics): Power/Toughness/Speed/Intelligence stats, element affinity, SCV-controlled sub-agents with four AI tiers (Basic → Elite). Multi-intelligence combat allows simultaneous personal CPI-driven combat + creature direction. MTG stack resolution + Pokémon type advantage. Tree health pools derived from structural integrity; combat defeat does not permanently damage the real tree. Summon sources: founder registry, physical card mapping (§43.7), discovery-unlocked triggers. No user-created AI entities outside registry. All balance values Category A (community-governed).

**Vehicular Proximity Mesh (§74b, contracts #301-304)**: Every vehicle running Relay is a mobile proximity channel. VehicleChannelNode uses motion-compensated BLE/WiFi handshake with ephemeral link lifecycle (DISCOVERED → LINKED → ACTIVE → FADING → GONE). Four privacy tiers (SILENT through OPEN) give vehicle owners complete control. Broadcast profiles as SapPackets with mesh-link TTL. Backseat Mode creates age-gated child-to-child social layer with BackseatGovernancePacket — parental controls for voice/text/AR/broadcast/radius/friend requests/session timeout, auto-dissolve on separation, dual-parent approval for persistent contact. Crowd-sourced navigation via anonymous aggregate segment-level pressure/heat/fog using §74.4 equations — no central server, no tracking, community-reported TrafficEventFilaments with multi-vehicle confirmation. Safety Mesh (opt-in only): camera-detected plates hashed immediately and irreversibly, checked against active safety registries (Amber/stolen/hit-and-run), no match = hash destroyed with no trace, match = SafetyAlertFilament. Driver Mode locks all interactive features during motion, delegates to passengers, preserves voice-only navigation and emergency alerts.

**Procedural Governance Template (§72.11, contract #300)**: Ritualized meeting structure for every Relay council (global, regional, organizational, branch-level), based on parliamentary procedure (BBYO/B'nai B'rith model). Six mandatory roles: Chair (moderates, cannot unilaterally pass), Treasurer (reports financial branch state), Recorder (commits minutes), Sergeant-at-Arms (enforces speaking order), Parliamentarian (validates motions), Members (propose, amend, vote). Meetings are structured branch subtrees with defined anatomy (agenda, reports, motions, amendments, votes, minutes, attendance). Motions follow filament lifecycle: OPEN (proposed) → ACTIVE (seconded by distinct member + debated with timeboxed window) → HOLD (called to question, amendments frozen) → CLOSED (voted: passed/failed) → ABSORBED (implementation evidence exists, budget reconciled, no appeals pending). Amendments are version bumps (child filaments), not edits — cross-section shows amendment history. Vote resolution via CouncilVotePacket with configurable weight schemes (equal/anchor/context, Category A). Procedural violations produce permanent ProceduralViolationPacket scars on the meeting branch. Consolidation gate prevents symbolic resolutions — passed motions that go unimplemented stay at surface, visible, wilting. Council procedural rules are meta-votable but require Layer 3 elevated threshold to change. The Top Relay Council on Tree Zero is the first instantiation and the public template for all governance. Role structure, motion lifecycle, second requirement, consolidation gate, and scar mechanism are frozen.

**Global & Regional Content Classification — The Oblivion Threshold (§72.12, contract #315)**: Civilizational-scale content governance without censorship. Humanity may vote (85% civilizational supermajority, 75% frozen floor) to classify content as purely destructive — nuclear weapons construction, atom-splitting for annihilation, technologies that only destroy. Classified content receives an oblivion gravity multiplier sinking it below a system-wide visibility floor, below every user's default filter. Nothing is deleted (append-only preserved). Anyone can deliberately lower their filter below the oblivion floor to view classified content — the act is itself a committed, auditable filament. The classification (proposal, evidence, vote record, pattern library) is permanently and publicly visible on Tree Zero. Regional governance adds stricter local classifications (75% regional supermajority, 72-hour cooling) but can never weaken global ones — global is the absolute floor. Camera detection uses the opt-in detection mesh (§39) with community-curated Pattern Libraries containing positive, negative, and ambiguous boundary examples — trained understanding, not black-box algorithms. Detection creates records with standard evidence physics, never automatic punishment. Violence flagging follows the same non-pervasive pipeline: opt-in cameras, transparent rules, standard confidence physics, emergency dispatch (§74) for life-threatening situations. Protected Participation Profiles (§63.7) cannot lower their filter below the oblivion floor. Cross-references: §12.5 (oblivion floor in filter tolerances), §83.5 (immune detection integration), §92 (SCV pattern matching routing), §102 (oblivion search scope). All thresholds, confidence floors, and gravity multipliers are Category A parameters. Classifications are revocable by the same supermajority mechanism.

**Relay Lite — One System, Fog Reveal (§81.9.2, contract #316)**: There is no separate Relay Lite binary. There is ONE system. Every user downloads and installs the same Relay. The difference between a first-day user and a civilization-scale operator is not what they installed — it is how much fog has lifted. Feature availability is governed by Conceptual LOD fog (§81.8), which lifts through natural engagement — never through purchase, hardware tier, or explicit unlock. Device capability affects rendering quality (resolution, particle count, SCV intelligence tier) but never feature access. Assets stream progressively as fog lifts, following the user's discovery path rather than predefined download stages. The GenesisBundle (< 50MB) ships with every binary for full offline operation. A user on a feature phone and a user on a VR headset at the same engagement level see the same fog boundary at different visual fidelity.

**Silence Stability Doctrine — Formalized (§81.3, contract #190 expanded)**: Four-state machine for parameter governance inertia: ACTIVE → QUIET (N epochs silence, 65% threshold) → STABLE (2N epochs, 80% threshold) → SEALED (4N epochs, 90% threshold). Continuous inertia equation: `stabilityWeight = min(1.0, silentEpochs / (4N))`. Rate-of-change caps tighten proportionally (20% → 5% per epoch). Reactivation triggers notification cascade and 3-epoch graceful thaw window preventing flash-mob hijacking. Renders as progressive visual encasement: normal → amber ring → golden seal → crystalline age rings. Edge cases addressed: mass reactivation attack, legitimate urgent change, oscillation attack.

**Trust Half-Life Equation (§83.6, contract #317)**: Equation 14 — universal temporal decay for all assertions: `trustWeight = initialWeight × 2^(−Δt / τ)`. Context-dependent half-lives from 30 days (social votes) to 5 years (scientific data); oblivion classifications and frozen contracts exempt (infinite). Re-evidencing events (new evidence, confirming votes, counterparty attestation, integrity verification) reset decay counter. Feeds into confidence, wilt, photosynthesis, dormancy, and silence stability. Renders as progressive translucency from vibrant to ghost-state. Templates declare domain-specific half-lives with global minimum floor. The equation is Relay's temporal turgor pressure: assertions not maintained lose structural weight.

**Video Conferencing & Camera Awareness Protocol (§39.7, contract #318)**: Video calling in Relay uses the same camera detection layer, but SCV training is a SEPARATE, EXPLICIT opt-in on top of video activation. Video ON means video only — no training, no gesture mapping, no environmental cataloguing. Training ON is a distinct toggle requiring full disclosure of what is collected (face, hands, posture, voice, environment), how it is processed (locally T0/T1, never transmitted to servers), and what it enables (voice commands, gesture control, AR overlays, detection pipeline). Detection levels are explicit opt-ins revealed by fog: VIDEO_ONLY (default) → TRAINING (user opts in with disclosure) → GESTURE_DETECTION (user opts in) → FULL_DETECTION (user opts in). No level activates without the user specifically selecting it. Six mandatory camera state indicators: OFF (no indicator), CALL ACTIVE (green — video only), TRAINING ACTIVE (amber — SCV learning), DETECTION ACTIVE (amber + white), MESH CONTRIBUTING (amber + blue), RECORDING (red + label). Hardware camera LED is always accurate — no silent camera access. Recording requires visible indicator to all participants; hidden recording produces a procedural violation scar. Video calling is the entry point; deeper capabilities are offered progressively through fog but always require informed, explicit consent.

**Kinetic Input Rate — Movement as Power Generation (§43.10.14, contract #319)**: Movement is a fixed, measurable input in Relay combat. `KIR(t) = Σ(velocity(zone) × mass(zone) × continuity(zone))` — camera-tracked zone velocity × zone mass × continuity multiplier produces the Kinetic Input Rate, which generates Action Points (AP) over time. Stillness generates zero AP. Sustained motion accumulates AP for spell amplification, combo extension, defensive recovery, and crowd engagement. Continuity multiplier rewards unbroken motion — resetting on pause. Nunchucks produce the highest sustained KIR due to continuous rotational motion; guard stance produces zero. Creates a fundamental aggressive/defensive/rhythmic risk-reward dynamic: aggressive style (high KIR, more AP, more exposure), defensive style (zero KIR, safe but no AP reservoir), rhythmic style (sustained moderate KIR, balanced). The kinetic conversion rate and per-weapon multipliers are Category A parameters.

**Physical Sport Arenas — Paintball as Battle Training (§68.20, contract #320)**: Any real-world physical sport played in a camera-equipped Relay space becomes a live battle training arena. Cameras detect physical actions (projectile tracking, body-zone hit detection, paint/impact splatter analysis, player movement and posture). AR overlays render real-time destruction graphics on hit surfaces and players, accumulating over the match to show battle history. SCV tracks precision metrics per player: shot accuracy, body-zone scoring (head > torso > limb), movement KIR, tactical positioning (cover transitions, flanking), territory control via paint coverage. Physical projectiles and equipment map to the spell/weapon system: paintball markers are spell weapons, paint colors are elements (red = fire, blue = ice, green = earth, yellow = lightning), firing is spell casting with Power cost. Spectators see live data feeds with kill cams, territory heatmaps, and leaderboards. The model generalizes to any camera-detectable sport (laser tag, archery, fencing, martial arts, dodgeball). All match data commits as arena filaments with deterministic replay.

**Founder Presentation Format — User Sphere Reveal (§88.10, contract #321)**: The primary Relay presentation follows a two-act structure. Act 1 (60-90s) is a professional software demo in standard screen-recording format — deliberately understated, targeting conventional enterprise/education/governance audiences ("this is a nice-looking data tool"). Act 2 transitions to the founder presenting from inside a user sphere — a transparent navigable bubble in the live 3D Relay world. The founder flies through real data (personal tree, Master Plan branch, globe, arena, municipality) explaining concepts by touching and interacting with live filaments. The revelation: Act 1 and Act 2 show the same system at different Conceptual LOD tiers (§81.8). The professional entry was the tree at C0; the sphere reveal is the tree at C4. Production uses volumetric capture or green-screen compositing into the live Relay engine. The two-act structure and the requirement that Act 2 uses the real running system (not CGI or mockups) are frozen.

**The 6 YELLOW items** (all non-critical):

1. **§15 Time Scrubbing** — Missing scrubbing UI schema, frame-rate constraints, privacy interaction during replay. No frozen contract. Superseded in practice by §48.4 (Replay) which is GREEN.
2. **§18 Flow Channels** — Missing FlowChannel schema and frozen contract. Conceptual section that needs formal binding.
3. **§24 Search in 3D** — Functionally superseded by §102 (full schemas, 4 frozen contracts). Should be collapsed to a forward-reference.
4. **§34 Use Case: Software Development** — Good narrative, no template schema mapping dev artifacts to filament objectTypes.
5. **§35 Use Case: Municipal Services** — Good narrative, no municipal template schema (though §21.2.3 has one — needs cross-reference).
6. **§36 Use Case: Astronomy** — No astronomical template schema, unclear Laniakea LOD integration with non-Earth time mechanics.

**Overall: 95% GREEN. Zero RED. Architecturally publish-ready.**

The next frontier is implementation and performance stress testing.
