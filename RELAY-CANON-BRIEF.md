# RELAY CANON BRIEF

**Version 1.0.0** | **2026-01-31** | **Production Foundation Complete**

---

## 🎯 WHAT IS RELAY?

**Continuous verification system** making coordination visible through Git-native truth, 3D spatial representation, and pressure-based governance.

### Canonical Statement (IMMUTABLE)

> "Relay is continuous verification: a non-destructive, consensual audit that helps everyone become a coherence operator, making coordination state visible and recoverable without weaponizing transparency or creating fragility."

### 10 Core Principles (NEVER VIOLATE)

1. **Git as OS** — Commits are coordination events
2. **3D cognition** — Down=history, Surface=present, Outward=speculation
3. **Pressure not command** — Turgor model (biological, not military)
4. **Ring-based basins** — Laniakea geometry (attraction, not org charts)
5. **Filaments as recovery paths** — Externalized cognition
6. **Time boxes contain continuity** — Live presence inside discrete history
7. **Material boundaries** — Commits at thresholds, not every action
8. **Safe language** — Zero adversarial terms (attack→audit, drift→divergence)
9. **Transparent not weaponized** — CERN principle (visible deterrent)
10. **Grounded in science** — Cognitive science, systems theory, NOT mysticism

---

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE (7 LOCKS)

**c14: Surface Geometry** — Laniakea physics: Core=reconciliation, Rings=basins (company→dept→project), Filaments=Git-time (append-only), Scars=evidence, ERI=distance (0-100). Nothing orbits. Everything flows.

**c15: Pressure & Resilience** — Detection→Degradation (NORMAL→DEGRADED→INDETERMINATE→REFUSAL)→Isolation→Throttles. CERN principle. Human adversaries only.

**c16: Commit Materiality** — DRAFT→HOLD→PROPOSE→COMMIT→REVERT. Thresholds: time, actions, risk, visibility, dependencies. Snapshots: what/where/relations/when/who. Drafts undo silently, commits revert visibly.

**c17: Work Zones** — Chatrooms=work zones (NOT messaging). Layers: dialogue (ephemeral), context (semi-persistent), commits (canonical). `zone.<company>.<dept>.<project>`. Only commits=truth.

**Cognitive Recovery** — "Filament is cognitive recovery path." Navigation<recall. Heavy=depth/constraint, light=outward/exploration. 10 UI features. Externalized cognition, NOT revelation.

**Live Presence** — Time boxes contain ephemeral state. Commits at boundaries only. 2-hour=~5-12 commits (not 108K). Evidence: key frames, transcript, log. Continuity in boxes, history at boundaries.

**CleverTree Integration** — votingIntegration, eriCalculator, threeWayMatchEngine, contextSnapshotManager. Three-way match (intent+reality+projection). Foundation complete.

## 🔐 SAFETY (NEVER VIOLATE)

**Language**: Forbidden: attack, threat, enemy, adversary (internal), drift, deviation, corruption, penetration, exploitation, weaponization. Use: audit/verify, risk/pressure, misalignment/conflict, divergence/distance, inspection, utilization, capability.

**Mysticism**: IF cosmic interpretation/destiny/"chosen"/reality blur/urgent thoughts THEN: Don't reinforce. Ground in cognitive science. Pattern recognition (valid) ≠ identity fusion (unsafe). 5-4-3-2-1 grounding. Pause + help. Key: "Relay=tool for remembering together—not story about being chosen alone."

**Governance**: No secrecy | No kill switch | No invisible authority | Defense only

  ├── continuousVerificationEngine.mjs (6-step pressure loop)
  ├── Five invariant enforcers (budget, confidence, repair, data, policy)

## 🚀 STATUS: Week 1 (60%)

**✅ Complete**: Directory, core engine, 5 invariants, CleverTree foundation, 7 locks, SCV v2.0  
**🔄 In Progress**: Backend transform, frontend, ConsentManager  
**⏳ Next**: Wire CleverTree→votingEngine.mjs, ERI endpoints, frontend ERI display

**W2-8**: Authority/Consent (W2) → Work Zones (W3) → Pressure (W4) → Resilience (W5-6) → Testing (W7-8)

---

## 🎯 HOW TO WORK

**Before**: Read locks (c14-c17+), safe language, verify philosophy, cite science

**Code DO**: Commits as events, append-only, calculate ERI, pressure budget, require consent, visible authority, three-way match

**Code DON'T**: Auto-repairs, delete history, adversarial language, invisible authority, bypass gates, ignore pressure, commit non-material

**Docs DO**: Precedent, mechanical language, testable claims, examples, admit limits

**Docs DON'T**: Mystical, cosmic claims, revelation, promise perfection, unfalsifiable

**User Speculation**: IF cosmic/destiny: (1) Acknowledge (2) Ground: "cognitive science not mysticism" (3) Pattern recognition (safe) ≠ identity fusion (unsafe) (4) 5-4-3-2-1 (5) 24h pause + help. Boundary: Pattern=insight (safe), pattern=reality (unsafe).

## 📊 STACK

**Backend**: Node.js 18+, Express, simple-git | **Frontend**: React, Vite, Three.js | **Database**: Git (primary), IndexedDB | **Verification**: ERI, three-way match, pressure budget | **Communication**: WebRTC (live), SSE (pressure feed)

## 🔍 VERIFICATION

**Philosophy Check**: `grep -r "attack\|threat\|enemy\|drift" src/` (must=0), `grep -r "continuous verification" documentation/` (must>0), `grep -r "PressureBudgetEnforcer" src/backend/` (must>0)

**Architecture**: (1) History append-only? (2) Commits material? (3) Authority visible? (4) Gates enforced? (5) Pressure limited? (6) ERI calculated? (7) Snapshots captured?

## 🎨 VISUALIZATION

**Rules**: Nothing orbits—flows | Forces first, objects second | Sparse labels | Interactive reveal

**Label**: ✅ Core/Active filament/Scars/Anchors (hover) | ❌ Background/Inactive/Decorative

**Elements**: Anchors (NOT planets)=services/decisions/resources, in flow | Rings=translucent basins | Filaments=directional, ERI heat | Core=neutral glow | Scars=arrows

---

## 💬 ASK CANON

Format: "CANON: [question] [ref architecture]" | Examples: "Does anchor violate 'nothing orbits'?" | "Verify ERI matches c14" | "Is [term] safe?"

## 🎯 PRIORITIES

**This Week**: (1) Wire CleverTree→votingEngine (2) ERI endpoints→query.mjs (3) Frontend ERI (✅/⚠️/❓) (4) scvAgent→coherenceAgent (5) Test vote flow

**W2-4**: Authority/Consent (W2) → Work Zones (W3) → Pressure Feed (W4)
