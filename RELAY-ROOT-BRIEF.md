# RELAY ROOT BRIEF

**Version 1.0.0** | **2026-01-31** | **Production Foundation Complete**

---

## 🎯 WHAT IS RELAY?

**Continuous verification system** making coordination visible through Git-native truth, 3D spatial representation, and pressure-based governance.

### Canonical Statement (IMMUTABLE)

> "Relay is continuous verification: a non-destructive, consensual audit that helps everyone become a coherence operator, making coordination state visible and recoverable without weaponizing transparency or creating fragility."

### 10 Core Principles (NEVER VIOLATE)

1. **Git as OS** — Commits are coordination events
2. **3D cognition** — Down=history, Surface=present, Outward=speculation
3. **Pressure not command** — Turgor model (biological, not military)
4. **Ring-based basins** — Laniakea geometry (attraction, not org charts)
5. **Filaments as recovery paths** — Externalized cognition
6. **Time boxes contain continuity** — Live presence inside discrete history
7. **Material boundaries** — Commits at thresholds, not every action
8. **Safe language** — Zero adversarial terms (attack→audit, drift→divergence)
9. **Transparent not weaponized** — CERN principle (visible deterrent)
10. **Grounded in science** — Cognitive science, systems theory, NOT mysticism

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE (7 LOCKS)

**c14: Surface Coordination Geometry** — Laniakea physics: Core=reconciliation filament, Rings=basins (company→dept→project), Filaments=Git-time continuums (append-only), Merge scars=permanent evidence, ERI=distance from core (0-100). Nothing orbits. Everything flows.

**c15: Pressure Management & Resilience** — Human-scale protection: Detection→Degradation (NORMAL→DEGRADED→INDETERMINATE→REFUSAL)→Isolation (ring-level)→Throttles. Defense via CERN principle. Threat model: Human adversaries only.

**c16: Commit Materiality & Context Evidence** — Five states: DRAFT→HOLD→PROPOSE→COMMIT→REVERT. Materiality thresholds (time, actions, risk, visibility, dependencies). Context snapshots (what/where/relations/when/who). Undo vs revert: drafts undo silently, commits revert visibly.

**c17: Work Zones & SCV Co-Location** — Chatrooms=shared work zones (NOT messaging). Three layers: dialogue (ephemeral), context (semi-persistent), commits (canonical). Zone: `zone.<company>.<dept>.<project>`. Only commits are truth.

**Cognitive Recovery Paths** — "A filament is a cognitive recovery path." Navigation cheaper than recall. Heavy (depth/constraint) vs light (outward/exploration). 10 UI features: breadcrumbs, "Where Was I?", activity trail, context-aware back. Externalized cognition, NOT revelation.

**Live Presence & Time Boxes** — Time boxes contain ephemeral state (video, audio, cursor, edits). Commits at material boundaries only. 2-hour session=~5-12 commits (not 108,000). Evidence: key frames, transcript, activity log. Continuity inside boxes, history at boundaries.

**CleverTree 3D Integration** — Four modules: votingIntegration, eriCalculator, threeWayMatchEngine, contextSnapshotManager. Three-way match (intent+reality+projection). ERI=distance from core. Status: Foundation complete, wiring in progress.

## 🔐 SAFETY CONSTRAINTS (NEVER VIOLATE)

### Language Rules (Zero Tolerance)
**Forbidden**: attack, threat, enemy, adversary (internal), drift, deviation, corruption, penetration, exploitation, weaponization.  
**Use instead**: audit/verify, risk/pressure, misalignment/conflict, divergence/distance, inspection, utilization, capability.

### Mysticism Boundary (CRITICAL)
**IF user shows**: cosmic interpretation, destiny narratives, "only I am chosen", reality/metaphor blurring, urgent unstoppable thoughts.  
**THEN**: Don't reinforce. Ground in cognitive science. Distinguish pattern recognition (valid) from identity fusion (unsafe). Provide 5-4-3-2-1 grounding. Recommend pause + professional help.  
**Key**: "Relay is a tool for remembering together—not a story about being chosen alone."

### Governance Constraints
No secrecy-by-obscurity | No central kill switch | No invisible authority | No weaponization (defense only)

**🔄 In Progress**: Backend transform (scvAgent→coherenceAgent), frontend, ConsentManager  
**⏳ Next**: Wire CleverTree to votingEngine.mjs, add ERI endpoints, frontend ERI display

**Weeks 2-8**: Authority/Consent (W2) → Work Zones (W3) → Pressure Infrastructure (W4) → Resilience (W5-6) → Testing (W7-8)

## 🎯 HOW TO WORK ON RELAY

**Before Code**: Read locks (c14-c17+), use safe language, verify philosophy, cite science (not speculation)

**Code DO**: Git commits as events, append-only history, calculate ERI, apply pressure budget, require consent, visible authority, three-way match (intent+reality+projection)

**Code DON'T**: Auto-execute repairs, delete history, adversarial language, invisible authority, bypass gates, ignore pressure floors, commit non-material changes

**Docs DO**: Lead with precedent, mechanical language, testable claims, concrete examples, admit limitations

**Docs DON'T**: Mystical language, cosmic claims, present as revelation, promise perfection, unfalsifiable claims

**User Speculation Protocol**: **IF** cosmic/destiny narratives: (1) Acknowledge insight valid (2) Ground: "cognitive science, not mysticism" (3) Distinguish pattern recognition (safe) from identity fusion (unsafe) (4) Provide 5-4-3-2-1 grounding (5) Recommend 24h pause + professional help. **Boundary**: Pattern recognition=insight (safe). Pattern=reality=narrative (unsafe).

## 📊 STACK

**Backend**: Node.js 18+, Express, simple-git | **Frontend**: React, Vite, Three.js | **Database**: Git (primary), IndexedDB | **Verification**: ERI, three-way match, pressure budget | **Communication**: WebRTC (live), SSE (pressure feed)

## 🔍 VERIFICATION

**Philosophy Check**: `grep -r "attack\|threat\|enemy\|drift" src/` (must=0), `grep -r "continuous verification" documentation/` (must>0), `grep -r "PressureBudgetEnforcer" src/backend/` (must>0)

**Architecture**: (1) History append-only? (2) Commits material? (3) Authority visible? (4) Gates enforced? (5) Pressure limited? (6) ERI calculated? (7) Snapshots captured?

## 🎨 VISUALIZATION

**Rules**: (1) Nothing orbits—everything flows (2) Forces first, objects second (3) Sparse labels (4) Interactive revelation

**Label**: ✅ Core/Active filament/Merge scars/Anchors (hover) | ❌ Background stars/Inactive filaments/Decorative

**Elements**: **Anchors** (NOT planets)=services/decisions/resources, embedded in flow | **Rings**=translucent basins | **Filaments**=directional, heat-coded by ERI | **Core**=neutral glow | **Merge scars**=directional arrows

**When**: Architecture interpretation, philosophy compliance, contradictions, design decisions, safety boundaries

## 🎯 PRIORITIES
