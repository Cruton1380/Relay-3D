feat: Add complete Stage 1 specifications and documentation

This commit includes all critical Relay Stage 1 implementation specs:

Core Implementation:
- CANON-START-HERE.md: Entry point and roadmap
- CANON-RELAY-CORE-IMPLEMENTATION.md: Complete coordination physics
- RELAY-HUMAN-FLOW-CONTROL-V2.md: Human sustainability primitives
- RELAY-3D-VISUALIZATION-SPEC.md: 3D rendering rules (fields, flows, constraints)
- CANON-IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md: Step-by-step build plan

Documentation:
- Relay SCV v2.2: Complete onboarding companion
- FILE-CATEGORIZATION-MASTER.md: Documentation structure
- RELAY-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES-REVIEW.md: Core principles analysis
- RELAY-GENESIS-PRINCIPLES.md: Genesis canon definition

Business Logic:
- BUSINESS-BEST-PRACTICES-ADOPTION.md: Business coordination patterns
- RELAY-PROCUREMENT-BIDDING-SPEC.md: Procurement implementation example
- RELAY-NATIVE-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md: Scope clarification

Human Flow Control:
- Participation states (exit/pause/dormant)
- Soft divergence
- Cooling windows
- Minority load relief
- Round-robin as conservation law
- Federation boundaries

3D Visualization:
- Scalar fields (value)
- Vector fields (flow)
- Constraint fields (limits)
- ERI gradients (repair paths)
- Confidence modulation
- Round-robin token visualization

Stage 1 proves: coordination is mechanically enforceable,
participation is humane, disagreement is survivable, and exit is safe.
