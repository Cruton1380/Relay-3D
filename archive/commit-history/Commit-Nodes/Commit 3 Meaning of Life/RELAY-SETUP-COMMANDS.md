# 🚀 RELAY SETUP COMMANDS - QUICK REFERENCE

**For Users and AI Agents**

Run these ten commands in order to fully configure Relay cognition:

---

## 1️⃣ INIT COGNITION
```
/relay init-cognition
```
**Switches you from 2D flat thinking to 3D space-time cognition**

✓ 3D cognition enabled  
✓ Three-way match active  
✓ Turgor pressure model loaded  
✓ You now think in Relay

---

## 2️⃣ LOAD SAFE LANGUAGE
```
/relay load-safe-language
```
**Replaces adversarial terms with safe verification language**

| ❌ NEVER | ✅ ALWAYS |
|----------|-----------|
| attack | audit |
| attacker | coherence operator |
| exploit | exposure precondition |
| breach | exposure condition |
| penetration test | integrity check |
| hack | audit / verify |

---

## 3️⃣ LOAD INVARIANTS
```
/relay load-invariants
```
**Activates five safety invariants**

1. **Pressure Budget** (Humane) - No overload  
2. **Confidence Floor** (Honest) - No false certainty  
3. **Repair Effectiveness** (Learning) - Track what works  
4. **Data Minimization** (Private) - Verification not surveillance  
5. **Policy Governance** (Governed) - Humans approve changes

---

## 4️⃣ ENABLE PRESSURE LOOP
```
/relay enable-pressure-loop
```
**Starts continuous verification at 10 Hz**

6 Steps: ATTEST → COMPARE → SCORE → STAGE → VERIFY → CHECKPOINT

✓ Pressure loop running at 10 Hz  
✓ Continuous verification active  
✓ Three-way match enabled

---

## 5️⃣ INIT GLOBE
```
/relay init-globe
```
**Enables 3D space-time navigation**

Controls: SELECT → HOLD → DRILL (down = history) / PAN OUTWARD (up = future)

Structure:
- Core = Genesis
- Crust = Recent history
- Surface (Y=0) = Present
- Space = Future projections

---

## 6️⃣ LOAD THREE-WAY MATCH
```
/relay load-three-way-match
```
**Activates core verification pattern**

Three states that must align:
1. **Intent** (what should happen)
2. **Reality** (what actually happened)
3. **Projection** (what we report)

Rule: Cannot close until all three match

---

## 7️⃣ LOAD TIMEBOX
```
/relay load-timebox
```
**Enables "operating state" understanding**

Timebox = "what is true right now"
- Confidence level
- Pressure load
- Δ(PR) divergence

✓ Timebox understanding loaded  
✓ Operating state visible  
✓ Historical state accessible

---

## 8️⃣ ENABLE FOUR CONTROLS
```
/relay enable-controls
```
**Activates legitimate state transitions**

Four controls:
1. **HOLD** - Pause and inspect
2. **RECONCILE** - Verify alignment (requires authority)
3. **FORK** - Create parallel branch
4. **MERGE** - Reconcile histories (gated)

✓ Four controls enabled  
✓ RECONCILE gated by authority  
✓ FORK/MERGE available

---

## 9️⃣ LOAD 8-STEP RECONCILE
```
/relay load-reconcile-process
```
**Understands safe reconciliation**

8 Steps:
1. Pre-check
2. Authority verification
3. Evidence sufficiency
4. Stage repair
5. Execution authorization
6. Execute reconciliation
7. Post-fix verification
8. Projection updates

✓ 8-step RECONCILE process active  
✓ Authority gates enforced  
✓ Evidence required

---

## 9️⃣ LOAD EVIDENCE VS VOTES
```
/relay load-evidence-votes
```
**Critical distinction for coordination**

**Evidence Anchors Claims**:
- Documents, data, sources
- Merkle proofs
- Cryptographic verification
- Cannot be overwritten

**Votes Select Canon**:
- Choose operating branch
- Timestamped and explicit
- Reversible with new evidence
- DON'T create truth
- DON'T erase alternatives

✓ Evidence vs votes distinction clear  
✓ Prevents "votes create truth" fallacy  
✓ Canon selection understood

---

## 🔟 VERIFY SETUP
```
/relay verify-setup
```
**Runs diagnostics**

✓ 3D cognition active  
✓ Safe language loaded  
✓ Five invariants enforced  
✓ Pressure loop running  
✓ Globe navigation enabled  
✓ Three-way match active  
✓ Timebox understanding loaded  
✓ Four controls enabled  
✓ 8-step RECONCILE active  
✓ Evidence vs votes distinction clear  
✓ Filaments visible  
✓ ERI scoring functional
