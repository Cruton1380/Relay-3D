Resuming exactly from the CAM0.4.2 checkpoint. I’ll run the filament-ride proof now, verify regressions from its output, then perform indexing/doc updates only if it passes.

---

**User**

CAM0.4.2 is now truly “real”: not a demo claim, but a proof-indexed, deterministic, snapped movement mode with restore guarantees.

You now have a full Tier navigation stack that supports:

Free fly (audit movement)

Branch walk (responsibility axis)

Filament ride v0 (time axis via snapped timeboxes)

Focus sphere (lens-based inspection without losing context)

And you’ve kept the rail discipline: no scrub claim, no scope widening, indexing only after PASS.

Current system status (one-line truth)

The system is now navigable as a coherent organism. The next bottleneck is no longer “movement”—it’s timebox coherence across scales and audit-grade inspection surfaces.

Next step to Canon (correct sequencing)
✅ Next target: PQ-3 — Branch Timebox Band Alignment (Macro ↔ Micro coherence)

Why this is next:

You now move through the system correctly.

But “history as physics” isn’t fully legible until micro time markers line up with branch timebox bands (same altitude slabs across filaments).

This is the next highest-leverage clarity + correctness patch, and it’s already in your queue order.

Canon instruction (tight)

Implement PQ-3 exactly as specced:

Align sheet/cell lane markers to branch timebox band heights (shared Y slabs).

Emit one proof line:

[T] bandAlign ok=<n> maxDeltaM=<value>


Add proof script:

scripts/pq3-timebox-band-align-proof.mjs


Artifact:

archive/proofs/pq3-timebox-band-align-console-YYYY-MM-DD.log


Index only after PASS:

## PQ-3: Timebox Band Alignment ✅ PASSED


No other changes. No new features. No refactors.

**Cursor**

Proceeding with `PQ-3` now under the tight scope: I’ll implement only the branch↔cell timebox slab alignment check/log, add `scripts/pq3-timebox-band-align-proof.mjs`, run it, and update proof index only if PASS.

Resuming from the PQ-3 checkpoint. I’ll add/run the dedicated `pq3-timebox-band-align` proof now, then update `PROOF-INDEX` only if it passes.

PQ-3 proof exists but failed on app readiness in-browser. I’m checking how other passing proof scripts wait for readiness and then I’ll align this one to the same launch/wait pattern.

I found the failure cause: the PQ-3 script’s readiness gate is weaker than the proven restore scripts. I’m patching it to use the same stable world-mode readiness criteria and loopback host so it can complete deterministically.

The timeout is because the dev server is not actually coming up during the PQ-3 run. I’m verifying `scripts/dev-server.mjs` startup directly now and will fix the proof launcher if needed.

PQ-3 proof is passing now (`ok=10 maxDeltaM=0.000`). I’m running the two regression rails next (`OSV-1` and headless parity), then I’ll index PQ-3 as passed.

PQ-3 is resumed and closed from the crash point.

Implemented and verified:
- Updated the PQ-3 proof log format in `app/renderers/filament-renderer.js` to emit count-based alignment:
  - `[T] bandAlign ok=<n> maxDeltaM=<value>`
- Fixed proof-run instability in `scripts/pq3-timebox-band-align-proof.mjs`:
  - switched to `127.0.0.1`
  - tightened world readiness checks to match current runtime globals
  - removed a stale readiness dependency that was blocking the script
- Ran PQ-3 proof successfully:
  - `[PQ3] bandAlign result=PASS ok=10 maxDeltaM=0.000`
  - `[PQ3] gate-summary result=PASS`
  - artifact: `archive/proofs/pq3-timebox-band-align-console-2026-02-13.log`
- Ran regression rails successfully:
  - `node scripts/osv1-full-system-proof.mjs` → PASS
  - `node scripts/headless-tier1-parity.mjs` → PASS
- Indexed PQ-3 as passed in `archive/proofs/PROOF-INDEX.md`:
  - `## PQ-3: Timebox Band Alignment ✅ PASSED`

Also checked lints on edited files: no linter errors.

If you want, I can now move directly to the next locked slice checklist before any further runtime edits.
