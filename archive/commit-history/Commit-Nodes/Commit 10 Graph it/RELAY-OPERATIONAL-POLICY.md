# Relay Operational Policy

**Global–Regional–Local Governance and Execution Model**

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: February 5, 2026  
**Scope**: Multi-site operations with distributed teams, vendors, and BOMs  
**Authority**: Corporate Governance

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines how Relay is operated across global, regional, and local levels to manage complex, multi-site operations involving:

- multiple plants
- multiple vendors
- multiple Bills of Material (BOMs)
- partial, outdated, or conflicting data
- changing personnel and responsibilities

The goal is to ensure:

- consistent decision-making
- traceable accountability
- controlled change
- visibility without overload
- safe operation during uncertainty

---

## 2. Operating Principles (Plain Language)

1. **Evidence comes first** – decisions are based on verified data, not assumptions.
2. **Decisions are explicit** – no silent overrides or hidden fixes.
3. **Uncertainty is allowed** – unclear situations are marked as such, not forced into false certainty.
4. **Authority is scoped** – global, regional, and local teams have different responsibilities.
5. **Change is controlled** – improvements are proposed, reviewed, and approved, not auto-applied.
6. **Capacity is respected** – teams are not overloaded; unresolved issues surface clearly.

---

## 3. Organizational Roles and Responsibilities

### 3.1 Global Level (Corporate / Headquarters)

#### Scope
- Company-wide policies
- Global vendor strategy
- Standard BOM definitions and rules
- System-wide thresholds and priorities

#### Responsibilities
Define and approve:
- global procurement policies
- vendor classification rules
- BOM governance standards

Resolve conflicts that span regions or plants

Approve structural changes that affect multiple sites

Maintain the authoritative "current operating standard"

#### What Global Does Not Do
- Does not manage daily orders
- Does not override local execution without documented justification
- Does not "fix data" directly at plant level

#### Cadence
- Policy review: **quarterly**
- Exception review: **as needed**
- Strategic vendor review: **quarterly / annually**

---

### 3.2 Regional Level (Cluster / Geography)

#### Scope
- Groups of plants within a region
- Regional vendors and logistics
- Cross-site coordination within the region

#### Responsibilities
Coordinate between plants on:
- shared vendors
- shared materials
- regional supply risks

Validate and escalate:
- recurring issues
- cross-plant inconsistencies

Propose regional adjustments to global policy

Ensure local teams follow approved standards

#### What Regional Does Not Do
- Does not change global rules independently
- Does not override plant execution unless risk is regional
- Does not redefine BOM structures unilaterally

#### Cadence
- Regional review: **monthly**
- Risk assessment: **monthly**
- Escalation to global: **when thresholds are exceeded**

---

### 3.3 Local Level (Plant / Site)

#### Scope
- Day-to-day execution
- Local vendors
- Active BOMs used in production
- Inventory, ordering, and scheduling

#### Responsibilities
Execute procurement and production using:
- approved BOMs
- approved vendors
- approved policies

Identify and report:
- inactive or outdated BOMs
- vendor delivery issues
- material mismatches

Propose local changes or corrections

Maintain operational data accuracy

#### What Local Does Not Do
- Does not redefine global BOM rules
- Does not bypass approval for structural changes
- Does not "work around" missing data without declaring it

#### Cadence
- Operational execution: **daily**
- Issue reporting: **real-time**
- Local review: **weekly**

---

## 4. Decision Types and Authority

| Decision Type | Local | Regional | Global |
|--------------|-------|----------|--------|
| Daily ordering | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Vendor issue (local) | ✅ | ⚠️ escalate if recurring | ❌ |
| Vendor issue (multi-site) | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| BOM correction (local impact) | ⚠️ propose | ✅ review | ❌ |
| BOM rule change (global) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Policy change | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**⚠️** = propose / escalate, not approve

---

## 5. Handling Uncertainty and Refusals

### 5.1 When the System Cannot Proceed

If required information, authority, or capacity is missing:

1. **The system stops the action**
2. **The reason is explicitly stated**
3. **Next allowed actions are clearly listed**

#### Examples
- Missing vendor approval
- BOM not validated
- Capacity exceeded
- Conflicting data across sites

**This is not a failure.**  
It is a **controlled pause** to prevent costly mistakes.

---

## 6. Change Management

### 6.1 Proposals

All changes begin as **proposals**, including:
- BOM updates
- Vendor changes
- Process adjustments

Proposals must include:
- reason for change
- impacted sites
- supporting evidence
- risk assessment

### 6.2 Approval

- **Local changes** → reviewed regionally
- **Regional changes** → reviewed globally
- **Global changes** → approved by corporate authority

**No change becomes active without explicit approval.**

---

## 7. Data Handling and Privacy

- Only data **required for decision-making** is collected
- **Aggregated data** is used by default
- Personal or sensitive data is **minimized**
- **Retention periods** are defined and enforced
- Access is **role-based** and **time-bound**

---

## 8. Training and Onboarding

- Training materials are **versioned and traceable**
- Staff are trained against a **specific operational standard**
- Changes to policy require **updated training**
- No **"tribal knowledge"** is relied upon

---

## 9. Capacity and Workload Management

- Each level has **defined workload limits**
- Excess issues trigger **escalation**, not overload
- The system prevents **silent backlog accumulation**

---

## 10. Exit and Transition

- Plants or regions can **transition processes** without penalty
- Historical data remains **intact and auditable**
- No loss of context during **personnel changes**

---

## 11. Summary (Executive View)

This policy ensures that:

✅ **Global sets direction**  
✅ **Regional coordinates risk**  
✅ **Local executes efficiently**  
✅ **No one is forced to guess**  
✅ **No one silently overrides**  
✅ **Problems surface early** instead of compounding

### This Directly Addresses:
- Fragmented vendors across sites
- Changing teams and personnel gaps
- Inactive BOMs still in system
- Multi-site coordination failures
- Lack of clear ownership
- Data scattered across locations

---

## 12. Compliance and Audit

This policy aligns with:
- ISO 9001 (Quality Management)
- SOX (Internal Controls)
- GDPR/Privacy (Data Minimization)
- Internal Audit Requirements

### Audit Trail Requirements
- All decisions are logged with:
  - Who made the decision
  - What authority they used
  - When it was made
  - What evidence supported it

### Exception Handling
- Exceptions require documented justification
- Approval at one level higher than normal authority
- Logged for quarterly review
