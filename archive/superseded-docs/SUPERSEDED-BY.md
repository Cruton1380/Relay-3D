# Superseded Documents

**Moved**: 2026-02-10
**Superseded by**: [docs/architecture/RELAY-MASTER-BUILD-PLAN.md](../../docs/architecture/RELAY-MASTER-BUILD-PLAN.md)

All documents in this directory have been fully absorbed into the canonical Relay Master Build Plan. They are retained here for historical reference only.

| File | Original Location | Why Superseded |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| RELAY-COMPLETE-BUILD-PLAN.md | docs/architecture/ | All phases (R0-E5) absorbed into master plan 5-tier structure |
| ROADMAP-CESIUM-FIRST.md | docs/implementation/ | Phase 0-8 roadmap restructured into D0/W0/SG0/C1/etc. |
| PATH-FORWARD-SUMMARY.md | docs/implementation/ | Content absorbed into Modules C, D, E, F, G |
| COMPLETE-SYSTEM-SUMMARY.md | docs/implementation/ | Architecture content in master plan sections 1-3 |
| UNDERSTANDING-CONFIRMED.md | docs/architecture/ | Historical comprehension checkpoint; no spec content |
| MODULE-COMPLETION-MATRIX.md | docs/implementation/ | Replaced by master plan section 10 (17-item coverage matrix) |
| PATCH-QUEUE-TOP10.md | docs/implementation/ | Replaced by master plan section 4 (Forward Build Sequence) |
| CANON-VERIFICATION.md | root + docs/implementation/ | Phase 3 gate block; verification protocol now in master plan section 5.7 |

**Rule**: Do not revive these files. If content is needed, reference the master plan.
