# Superseded Documents

**Moved**: 2026-02-10 (initial batch), 2026-02-16 (Universal Tree update, R1 absorption, doc consolidation)
**Superseded by**: [docs/architecture/RELAY-MASTER-BUILD-PLAN.md](../../docs/architecture/RELAY-MASTER-BUILD-PLAN.md)

All documents in this directory have been fully absorbed into the canonical Relay Master Build Plan (or are historical implementation records for completed phases). They are retained here for historical reference only.
